# longevity-research-exploration

This repository contains scripts and notebooks in Python to explore a subset of [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) database using [pymed](https://pypi.org/project/pymed/) API. (I've also been playing around with the unofficial [API for Sci-hub](https://github.com/zaytoun/scihub.py).)

The idea is to develop this into a tool to support the effort of finding promising rejuvenation therapies, interventions or medications by exploring the latest research in aging, geroscience and longevity. One good example is: [Risk-Benefit Analysis](https://brain.forever-healthy.org/display/EN/Dasatinib+and+Quercetin+Senolytic+Therapy) done by [Forever Healthy Fundation](https://www.forever-healthy.org/rejuvenation-now.html).

You can find a live demo of the developing tool: [here](https://observablehq.com/@markolalovic/exploring-research-papers-about-longevity)

TODO: Create features for evaluation based on:

  * the amount and quality of the evidence,
  * reproducibility, independent studies,
  * conflicting studies or conflict of interest (funding),
  * human or animal studies,
  * methodological flaws, sample size.
