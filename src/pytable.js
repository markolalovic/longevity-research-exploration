     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Cellular senescence contributes to age-related disorders including physical dysfunction, disabilities and mortality caused by tissue inflammation and damage. Senescent cells accumulate in multiple tissues with aging and at etiological sites of multiple chronic disorders. The senolytic drug combination, Dasatinib plus Quercetin (D+Q), is known to reduce senescent cell abundance in aged mice. However, the effects of long-term D+Q treatment on intestinal senescent cell and inflammatory burden and microbiome composition in aged mice remain unknown. Here, we examine the effect of D+Q on senescence (p16Ink4a and p21Cip1) and inflammation (Cxcl1, Il1, Il6, Mcp1, and Tnf) markers in small (ileum) and large (caecum and colon) intestine in aged mice (n=10) compared to age-matched placebo-treated mice (n=10). Additionally, we examine microbial composition along the intestinal tract in these mice. D+Q-treated mice show significantly lower senescent cell (p16 and p21 expression) and inflammatory (Cxcl1, Il1, Il6, Mcp1 and Tnf expression) burden in small and large intestine compared with control mice. Further, we find specific microbial signatures in ileal, cecal, colonic and fecal regions that are distinctly modulated by D+Q, with modulation being most prominent in small intestine. Further analyses reveal specific correlation of senescence and inflammation markers with specific microbial signatures. Together, these data demonstrate that the senolytic treatment reduces intestinal senescence and inflammation while altering specific microbiota signatures and suggest that the optimized senolytic regimens might improve health via reducing intestinal senescence, inflammation and microbial dysbiosis in older subjects.</span></div></label></td>\

The drug has been shown to act as a potent multikinase inhibitor by blocking not only the BCR-ABL1 gene sequence but also the SRC kinase family, though unexpected adverse events such as pleural effusion have recently been reported in patients undergoing treatment with dasatinib. Hemorrhagic colitis is a unique gastrointestinal adverse events associated with dasatinib and its pathogenesis remains poorly understood.We report here a case of dasatinib-induced asymptomatic colitis in a patient with CML, who showed no exacerbation in careful observations and maintained deep molecular response (DMR)during a 3-year period. In addition, we performed transcriptome analysis of inflamed colonic mucosa specimens to clarify the possible mechanism of colitis that develops in association with dasatinib administration. Our results demonstrated that differential gene expression, especially lymphocyte-associated genes and chemokines, is substantially involved in inflammation of colonic mucosa in affected patients.Dasatinib induces immune-mediated colitis following lymphocyte infiltration.</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Senolytics are a class of drugs that selectively clear senescent cells (SC). The first senolytic drugs Dasatinib, Quercetin, Fisetin and Navitoclax were discovered using a hypothesis-driven approach. SC accumulate with ageing and at causal sites of multiple chronic disorders, including diseases accounting for the bulk of morbidity, mortality and health expenditures. The most deleterious SC are resistant to apoptosis and have up-regulation of anti-apoptotic pathways which defend SC against their own inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), allowing them to survive, despite killing neighbouring cells. Senolytics transiently disable these SCAPs, causing apoptosis of those SC with a tissue-destructive SASP. Because SC take weeks to reaccumulate, senolytics can be administered intermittently - a hit-and-run approach. In preclinical models, senolytics delay, prevent or alleviate frailty, cancers and cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric, liver, kidney, musculoskeletal, lung, eye, haematological, metabolic and skin disorders as well as complications of organ transplantation, radiation and cancer treatment. As anticipated for agents targeting the fundamental ageing mechanisms that are root cause contributors to multiple disorders, potential uses of senolytics are protean, potentially alleviating over 40 conditions in preclinical studies, opening a new route for treating age-related dysfunction and diseases. Early pilot trials of senolytics suggest they decrease senescent cells, reduce inflammation and alleviate frailty in humans. Clinical trials for diabetes, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, Alzheimers disease, COVID-19, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, eye diseases and bone marrow transplant and childhood cancer survivors are underway or beginning. Until such studies are done, it is too early for senolytics to be used outside of clinical trials.</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major cause of limb dysfunction, and distraction arthroplasty which generates intermittent hydrostatic pressure (IHP) is an effective approach for OA treatment. However, the result was not always satisfactory and the reasons remained unresolved. Because aging is recognized as an important risk factor for OA and chondrogenic progenitor cells (CPCs) could acquire senescent phenotype, we made a hypothesis that CPCs senescence could have harmful effect on chondrogenesis and the outcome of distraction arthroplasty could be improved by eliminating senescent CPCs pharmacologically.The role of senescent CPCs on distraction arthroplasty was first determined by comparing the cartilage samples from the failure and non-failure patients. Next, the biological behaviors of senescent CPCs were observed in the in vitro cell culture and IHP model. Finally, the beneficial effect of senescent CPCs clearance by senolytic dasatinib and quercetin (DQ) on cartilage regeneration was observed in the in vitro and in vivo IHP model.Larger quantities of senescent CPCs along with increased IL-1  secretion were demonstrated in the failure patients of distraction arthroplasty. Senescent CPCs revealed impaired proliferation and chondrogenic capability and also had increased IL-1  synthesis, typical of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). CPCs senescence and SASP formation were mutually dependent in vitro. Greater amounts of senescent CPCs were negatively correlated with IHP-induced chondrogenesis. In contrast, chondrogenesis could be significantly improved by DQ pretreatment which selectively induced senescent CPCs into apoptosis in the in vitro and in vivo IHP model. Mechanistically, senescent CPCs elimination could decrease SASP formation and therefore promote the proliferation and chondrogenic regeneration capacity of the surrounding survived CPCs under IHP stimulation.Eliminating senescent CPCs by senolytics could decrease SASP formation and improve the result of joint distraction arthroplasty effectively. Our study provided a novel CPCs senescence-based therapeutic target for improving the outcome of OA treatment.</span></div></label></td>\

After 5 months on dasatinib, the patient presented with a large mass in the axillary region.Common infectious and autoimmune etiologies of lymphadenopathy were ruled out. The positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) demonstrated a hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy highly suspicious of lymphoma. The subsequent biopsy excluded lymphoma or extramedullary blastic transformation of CML and revealed reactive lymphadenopathy with mixed (cortical and paracortical) pattern. Clinical history and clinicopathological correlation suggested the diagnosis of DAL.Dasatinib was discontinued and the patient remained in close follow-up. TKI treatment with nilotinib was reinitiated.Lymphadenopathy resolved clinically at 4 weeks and normalization of PET/CT findings was documented at 9 weeks after cessation of the drug. TKI treatment with nilotinib was reinitiated with good tolerance.DAL may present with voluminous lymphadenopathy consistent with malignancy in clinical and imaging workup.

We performed dose-response, synergism, P-glycoprotein inhibition, and pharmacokinetic studies in in vitro and in vivo human and mouse models of HGG. Six patients with recurrent PDGFR-driven glioma were treated with dasatinib and everolimus. We found that dasatinib effectively inhibited the proliferation of mouse and human primary HGG cells with a variety of PDGFRA alterations. Dasatinib exhibited synergy with everolimus in the treatment of HGG cells at low nanomolar concentrations of both agents, with a reduction in mTOR signaling that persisted after dasatinib treatment alone. Prolonged exposure to everolimus significantly improved the CNS retention of dasatinib and extended the survival of PPK tumor-bearing mice (mutant TP53, mutant PDGFRA, H3K27M). Six pediatric patients with glioma tolerated this combination without significant adverse events, and 4 patients with recurrent disease (n = 4) had a median overall survival of 8.5 months.

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Cancer patients have an incidence of about 60% kidney disease development and are at elevated risk of acute renal damage. Kidney disease in these patients is frequently associated with nephrotoxicity from the ongoing oncological treatment. New anticancer therapeutic strategies, such as targeted therapies and immunotherapies, offer substantial benefits in the treatment of many neoplasms. However, their use is associated with significant nephrotoxicity, which qualitatively differs from that seen with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy, while the underlying mechanisms are complex and still to be clearly defined. Nephrologists need to be knowledgeable about the array of such renal toxicities for effective collaboration with the oncologist in the prevention and management of kidney involvement. Renal adverse effects may range from asymptomatic proteinuria to renal failure, and their prompt identification and timely treatment is essential for optimal and safe care of the patient. In this article, after presenting clinical cases we discuss the differing renal toxicity of three novel anticancer agents (aflibercept, dasatinib, and nivolumab) and possible measures to counter it.</span></div></label></td>\

Herein, we seek to ascertain the ocular safety/compatibility of blank and dasatinib loaded PEG-b-PCL micelles, which will set the stage for the future in vivo efficacy evaluations and/or clinical translation for PVR or other eye diseases.To access the safety of blank and dasatinib loaded micelles, in vitro cell based assays (LDH cell membrane damage test, SRB cytotoxicity, TEER and permeability of RPE tight junctions), in vivo slit lamp biomicroscopy and optical coherence tomography, Ex vivo histology (H&E staining, GFAP immunofluorescence staining and TUNEL assay) were undertaken.Both blank and dasatinib loaded micelles showed remarkable safety profiles at cellular levels. They also caused negligible ocular toxicity/abnormalities up to 28 days post-intravitreal injection in mice. The micelles did not insult the cornea, as demonstrated by slit-lamp biomicroscopy. Ex vivo histology and in vivo optical coherence tomography revealed a normal retinal structure with minimal apoptosis and stresses.Taken together, both blank and dasatinib loaded micelles appear to be safe and their applications in drug delivery for eye diseases should be explored.</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is defined as a lymphoma that occurs after solid-organ or hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT), caused by immunosuppression and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation. It is an important post-transplant complication that can be fatal. After HSCT, most PTLD occurs within 2 years. Recent evidence suggests that tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are expected to be effective maintenance therapy after HSCT for Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia. However, it is unclear whether the use of TKIs might pose a risk of developing PTLD after HSCT. We present the first case of late-onset PTLD during dasatinib treatment, which occurred 10 years after umbilical cord blood transplantation (CBT). A 59-year-old man who received CBT for chronic myeloid leukemia blast phase needed long-term dasatinib therapy for molecular relapse. Ten years after CBT, he developed diffuse-large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We observed chimerism of the DLBCL sample, which indicated complete donor type and EBV-DNA, and the patient was diagnosed with PTLD. Because of treatment resistance, he died 6 months after PTLD onset. Although he received no long-term administration of immunosuppressive agents, he received long-term dasatinib treatment, which suggests that prolonged dasatinib use after CBT caused EBV reactivation and led to PTLD. Our case suggests that the potential contribution of molecular-targeted agents after HSCT to the development of PTLD should be carefully considered.</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Dasatinib, as a second-generation broad-spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor, presents an antitumor effect by inhibiting tyrosine kinases. However, dasatinib causes serious side effects, such as gastrointestinal bleeding and liver toxicity, possibly through the activation of ROCK kinase and MLC phosphorylation. At present, there is no effective prevention and treatment method. Previous research studies have shown that YQFM (YiQiFuMai powder injection) protects the blood-brain barrier by inhibiting the ROCK/MLC signaling pathway; whether YQFM can alleviate the side effects of dasatinib is unknown. In this study, dasatinib was injected (i.p. 70mg/kg) and YQFM (i.p. 0.336g/kg, 0.672g/kg, 1.342g/kg) was given in advance for 3 days to mice, to explore the effect of YQFM on side effects induced by Dasatinib. The results confirmed that YQFM significantly decreased Evans blue leakage in the small intestine and increased intestinal blood flow, increased the expression of ZO-1, Occludin, and VE-cadherin, and reduced the contents of D-lactic acid, s-VE-cadherin, Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in serum. Finally, YQFM inhibited the expression of ROCK-1 and phosphorylation of MLC induced by Dasatinib. These findings suggested that YQFM could improve the side effects caused by Dasatinib linked with the ROCK/MLC signaling pathway, as shown in the graphical abstract.</span></div></label></td>\

Several studies showed the potential efficacy of these drugs in the management of triple-negative breast cancer- an aggressive subtype of breast cancer, which can develop during pregnancy. Nevertheless, side effects of Dasatinib (DA) and PD-L1 drugs during pregnancy, especially in the early stages of embryogenesis are not explored yet. The aim of this study is to assess the individual and combined toxicity of DA and PD-L1 inhibitors during the early stages of embryogenesis and to evaluate their effect(s) on angiogenesis using the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model of the embryo. Our results show that embryos die at greater rates after exposure to DA and PD-L1 inhibitors as compared to their matched controls. Moreover, treatment with these drugs significantly inhibits angiogenesis of the CAM. To further elucidate key regulator genes of embryotoxicity induced by the actions of PD-L1 and DA, an RT-PCR analysis was performed for seven target genes that regulate cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and survival (ATF3, FOXA2, MAPRE2, RIPK1, INHBA, SERPINA4, and VEGFC). Our data revealed that these genes are significantly deregulated in the brain, heart, and liver tissues of exposed embryos, compared to matched control tissues. Nevertheless, further studies are necessary to evaluate the effects of these anti breast cancer drugs and elucidate their role during pregnancy.</span></div></label></td>\

At resistance to AA, they were randomized 1:1 to combination with dasatinib or sunitinib. At second progression, patients crossed over. The primary end point was time to treatment failure (TTF), defined as time to progression or death. Secondary end points included overall survival and safety.From March 2011 to February 2015, a total of 179 patients were enrolled and 132 subsequently randomized. Median TTF was 5.7 months in the dasatinib group and 5.5 months in the sunitinib group. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of TTF (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.59-1.22). Median overall survival from study entry was 26.3 months in the dasatinib group and 27.7 months in the sunitinib group (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.71-1.47). Grade 3 or higher adverse events related to study medication were more frequent with sunitinib (n= 44, 46%) compared to dasatinib (n= 26, 24%). At data cutoff, 7 patients were experiencing a continuous response to AA, with a median duration of treatment of 5.7 years.There is no difference in overall survival and TTF between dasatinib and sunitinib combined with abiraterone in the treatment of patients with bone mCRPC.</span></div></label></td>\

Dasatinib (50mg twice daily) was given orally for 1week and escalated to 70mg twice daily orally. The primary endpoint was to the 3-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate. Blood samples were acquired before dasatinib therapy for examination of gene mutations by next-generation sequencing (NGS).From May 2016 to June 2018, 58 patients from 9 Chinese medical centers were enrolled in this study. The 3-month PFS rate was 53.4% and the median overall survival (OS) was 14.0months. Neither primary nor secondary gene mutations predicted the efficacy of dasatinib. Wild-type GIST patients had longer PFS (5.5months). The most common adverse events were anemia, proteinuria, fatigue, neutropenia, and diarrhea. The concordance of KIT/PDGFRA mutation was 61.9% between tissue and peripheral blood samples and additional KIT mutations were detected in the peripheral blood samples in 28.6% of the patients. Some SNV and CNV such as ATRX, TP53, TEKT4, STK11, SDHC, and CDKN2C related to tumor signaling pathways were detected.

Among them, the second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib (DAS), used as second-line treatment, has shown to be a valid option in patients with CP-CML after intolerance to prior IM.Herein, we report on seven CP-CML patients who achieved a stable major molecular response (MMR) with IM-therapy, but were shifted to DAS treatment due to recurrent low-grade IM-intolerances (grades 1-2).All patients received conventional DAS treatment with a median daily dose of 83.3 mg. Treatment was well tolerated and side-effects were mild. In addition, after a median follow-up of 25 months (range=24-43 months) a deep molecular response (DMR) (either MR</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Tumors are heterogeneous in nature, composed of different cell populations with various mutations and/or phenotypes. Using a single drug to encounter cancer progression is generally ineffective. To improve the treatment outcome, multiple drugs of distinctive mechanisms but complementary anticancer activities (combination therapy) are often used to enhance antitumor efficacy and minimize the risk of acquiring drug resistance. We report here the synergistic effects of salinomycin (a polyether antibiotic) and dasatinib (a Src kinase inhibitor).Functionally, both drugs induce cell cycle arrest, intracellular reactive oxygen species (iROS) production, and apoptosis. We rationalized that an overlapping of the drug activities should offer an enhanced anticancer effect, either through vertical inhibition of the Src-STAT3 axis or horizontal suppression of multiple pathways. We determined the toxicity induced by the drug combination and studied the kinetics of iROS production by fluorescence imaging and flow cytometry. Using genomic and proteomic techniques, including RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and Western Blot, we subsequently identified the responsible pathways that contributed to the synergistic effects of the drug combination.Compared to either drug alone, the drug combination showed enhanced potency against MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 human breast cancer (BC) cell lines and tumor spheroids. The drug combination induces both iROS generation and apoptosis in a time-dependent manner, following a 2-step kinetic profile. RNA-seq data revealed that the drug combination exhibited synergism through horizontal suppression of multiple pathways, possibly through a promotion of cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase via the estrogen-mediated S-phase entry pathway, and partially via the BRCA1 and DNA damage response pathway.Transcriptomic analyses revealed for the first time, that the estrogen-mediated S-phase entry pathway partially contributed to the synergistic effect of the drug combination. More importantly, our studies led to the discoveries of new potential therapeutic targets, such as E2F2, as well as a novel drug-induced targeting of estrogen receptor  (ESR2) approach for triple-negative breast cancer treatment, currently lacking of targeted therapies.</span></div></label></td>\

In TNBC, despite strong preclinical data, clinical trials of molecular targeted drugs, such as the Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib, have failed because of the heterogeneity of TNBC cells. Here, we examined the mechanism of intrinsic resistance to dasatinib in five TNBC cell lines. First, we divided the TNBC cell lines into those sensitive or resistant to dasatinib and found that activation of Src was inhibited in all of the cell lines. In contrast, we found that dasatinib inhibited Akt phosphorylation in only the dasatinib-sensitive cell lines. Consequently, we found that combination treatment with dasatinib and an inhibitor of Akt or mTOR suppressed cell proliferation more than did either monotherapy in the dasatinib-resistant cell lines. Finally, to mimic intrinsic resistance, we established a dasatinib-tolerant TNBC cell line. In this cell line, the combinational effect of Akt/mTOR inhibition with dasatinib was observed, as it was in the cell lines with intrinsic resistance. Together, the present results show that the effect of dasatinib in TNBC is independent of Src inhibition, and that Akt/mTOR inhibition might be an effective strategy to overcome TNBC cells with intrinsic dasatinib resistance.</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Cell senescence is defined as a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest combined with DNA damage and the induction of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). This includes increased secretion of many inflammatory agents, proteases, miRNAs, and others. Cell senescence has been widely studied in oncogenesis and has generally been considered to be protective, due to cell cycle arrest and the inhibition of proliferation. Cell senescence is also associated with ageing and extensive experimental data support its role in generating the ageing-associated phenotype. Senescent cells can also influence proximal "healthy" cells through SASPs and, e.g., inhibit normal development of progenitor/stem cells, thereby preventing tissue replacement of dying cells and reducing organ functions. Recent evidence demonstrates that SASPs may also play important roles in several chronic diseases including diabetes and cardiovascular disease. White adipose tissue (WAT) cells are highly susceptible to becoming senescent both with ageing but also with obesity and type 2 diabetes, independently of chronological age. WAT senescence is associated with inappropriate expansion (hypertrophy) of adipocytes, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. Major efforts have been made to identify approaches to delete senescent cells including the use of "senolytic" compounds. The most established senolytic treatment to date is the combination of dasatinib, an antagonist of the SRC family of kinases, and the antioxidant quercetin. This combination reduces cell senescence and improves chronic disorders in experimental animal models. Although only small and short-term studies have been performed in man, no severe adverse effects have been reported. Hopefully, these or other senolytic agents may provide novel ways to prevent and treat different chronic diseases in man. Here we review the current knowledge on cellular senescence in both murine and human studies. We also discuss the pathophysiological role of this process and the potential therapeutic relevance of targeting senescence selectively in WAT.</span></div></label></td>\

Senescence is generally regarded as a tumour suppressive process, both by preventing cancer cell proliferation and suppressing malignant progression from pre-malignant to malignant disease. It may also be a key effector mechanism of many types of anticancer therapies, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and endocrine therapies, both directly and via bioactive molecules released by senescent cells that may stimulate an immune response. However, senescence may contribute to reduced patient resilience to cancer therapies and may provide a pathway for disease recurrence after cancer therapy. A new group of drugs, senotherapies, (drugs which interact with senescent cells to interfere with their pro-aging impacts by either selectively destroying senescent cells (senolytic drugs) or inhibiting their function (senostatic drugs)) are under active investigation to determine whether they can enhance the efficacy of cancer therapies and improve resilience to cancer treatments. Senolytic drugs include quercetin, navitoclax, and fisetin and preclinical and early phase clinical data are emerging of their potential role in cancer treatments, although none are yet in routine use clinically.

The flavonol compound quercetin is considered to be an anti-aging agent due to its cytoprotective actions as an antioxidant. However, its role and mechanisms on aged oocytes are unclear. In this study, the quercetin promotes in vitro maturation (IVM) and early embryonic development of oocytes from aged mice. It is extended these findings in human oocytes, showing that quercetin promotes the IVM rate by 19.6% and increases the blastocyst formation rate by 15.5% compared to untreated controls. The overall oocyte quality of aged mice is improved by quercetin treatment, assessed as spindle/chromosome morphology and cortical granule distribution. Mitochondria is the primary endogenous source of age-related oxidative stress, and an RNA-seq analysis of quercetin-treated oocytes reveals molecular insights including scavenged mitochondrial-ROS, reduced apoptosis, and improved autophagy. Further, this study demonstrates that quercetin reduces ROS via SIRT3-mediated acetylation of SOD2s K68 residue. Thus, beyond demonstrating that quercetin confers beneficial mitochondria-related impacts in aged oocytes, this study illustrates a potential strategy to prevent or delay oocyte aging and to improve success rates of assisted human reproductive technologies (ART).</span></div></label></td>\

Histological (hematoxylin-eosin and SA--gal) and immunohistological (p16 and p21 for analyzing cellular senescence and 4-HNE for oxidation) staining was used to identify SIPS cells and elucidate the underlying mechanism. Bone formation in defects were analyzed using microcomputed tomography, one and four weeks after surgery. Parallel to LS-G implantation, local epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) administration, and systemic senolytic (dasatinib and quercetin: D+Q) administration were used to eliminate SIPS cells. After LS-G implantation, SA--gal-, p16-, and p21-positive cells (SIPS cells) accumulated in the defects. However, treatment with LS-G+EGCG and LS-G+D+Q resulted in lower numbers of SIPS cells than that with LS-G in the defects, resulting in an augmentation of newly formed bone. We demonstrated that SIPS cells induced by sustained stimulation by LPS may play a deleterious role in bone formation.

The cohort was divided into those entering before 2001 vs from 2001 onwards (when TKIs were introduced). We developed competing risks models to compare time-to-event in CML cases versus controls. We adjusted for baseline comorbidities and present subdistribution HRs and 95% CIs. The relationship between TKI use and MACE was assessed by logistic regression.Before 2001 and from 2001 on, patients with CML had a higher crude incidence of MACE than patients without CML (19.8 vs 15.3 and 20.3 vs 12.6 per 1000 person-years, respectively). After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, patients with CML had a lower subdistribution hazard for MACE (0.59, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.76) before 2001; but from 2001, the adjusted subdistribution HR for MACE (1.27, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.43) was similar to age-matched and sex-matched patients.

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Sepsis remains the most common cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients, increasing the risk of in-hospital and long-term death. Rhizoma Coptidis (RC), a classical traditional Chinese herb, exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in various diseases including sepsis. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of RC extracts (RCE) against sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) and explore the underlying mechanisms with metabolomics-based network pharmacology. The results showed that RCE improved renal function and histological injury and decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in SA-AKI. Using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS), 25 differential metabolites were identified that had a close connection with the pathological processes of SA-AKI and the effects of RCE. Afterward, a compound-metabolite-target-disease network was constructed and 17 overlapping target proteins of the components of RCE, the differential metabolites, and the disease-related genes were discovered. Among these overlapping target proteins, RCE increased the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), the protein expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), the mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor  (PPAR) and reduced nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) activity. In addition, molecular docking revealed that both berberine and quercetin could bond with NOS2 and PPAR, respectively. Therefore, RCE demonstrated protective effects for SA-AKI through the regulation of metabolism and different signaling pathways.</span></div></label></td>\

The aim of this study was to evaluate the burden of cardiovascular complications related to treatment with anti-BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and to determine if there are differences between the latest- and first-generation TKIs.A retrospective observational study was carried out on 55 patients (39 men, 16 women; mean age  SD: 58  11 years) treated with TKIs targeting Bcr-Abl for a median period of 3.5 years. Patients were divided in two groups according to the type of treatment. Group A included patients treated with latest-generation TKI (nilotinib, dasatinib, and ponatinib), while group B included patients treated with first-generation TKI (imatinib). Cardiological evaluation included electrocardiogram, echocardiogram with global longitudinal strain of left ventricle (GLS), and carotid ultrasound scan with arterial stiffness measurement (pulse wave velocity, PWV). Adverse cardiovascular events were recorded in both groups.Statistical analysis showed that cardiovascular adverse events (myocardial ischemia, peripheral artery disease, deep vein thrombosis, and pleural effusion) were significantly more frequent in group A than group B (p value = 0.044). Moreover, there was a significant reduction in GLS and PWV in group A when compared to group B (respectively, p = 0.03 and p = 0.004).Our study confirms that imatinib is a relatively safe drug, while it reveals that the latest-generation TKIs may cause a burden of cardiovascular complications. GLS and PWV allow detection of early signs of cardiac and vascular toxicity in oncohematologic patients treated with TKI, and their use is advisable.</span></div></label></td>\

Nevertheless, patients receiving TKIs report chronic adverse events such as fatigue, edema, and muscle cramps, which lead to a decrease in their quality of life (QoL). Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the QoL and symptom burden in patients receiving original imatinib, generic imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib.A total of 121 patients with CML who received TKIs for at least 3 months were enrolled in the study. The QoL was assessed with the Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Quality of Life Questionnaire-Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (QLQ-CML24) modules. The symptom burden was assessed with MD Anderson Symptom Inventory for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (MDASI-CML) and EORTC QLQ-CML24.The median age of the study population was 53 years (range, 28-90 years), and 83 (81.4%) patients had a low-to-medium Sokal risk score. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of most patients were good (< 2; 96%), and comorbidity scores were low (HCT-CI< 3; 90.8%). There was no significant difference between the general health status of patients in terms of EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CML24. According to the results of the MDASI-CML and QLQ-CML24 modules, the most common symptom was fatigue (58.7%) in all groups, and there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of the effects on the daily life activities of the patients.Patients with CML receiving first- and second-generation TKIs were seen to have a similar QoL and symptom burden.</span></div></label></td>\

Relapsed disease has a poor prognosis despite the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+ ALL) cases and immunotherapeutic approaches, including blinatumomab and chimeric antigen receptor T cells. Targeting aberrant cell survival pathways with selective small molecule BH3-mimetic inhibitors of BCL-2 (venetoclax, S55746), BCL-XL (A1331852), or MCL1 (S63845) is an emerging therapeutic option. We report that combined targeting of BCL-2 and MCL1 is synergistic in B-ALL in vitro. The combination demonstrated greater efficacy than standard chemotherapeutics and TKIs in primary samples from adult B-ALL with Ph+ ALL, Ph-like ALL, and other B-ALL. Moreover, combined BCL-2 or MCL1 inhibition with dasatinib showed potent killing in primary Ph+ B-ALL cases, but the BH3-mimetic combination appeared superior in vitro in a variety of Ph-like ALL samples. In PDX models, combined BCL-2 and MCL1 targeting eradicated ALL from Ph- and Ph+ B-ALL cases, although fatal tumor lysis was observed in some instances of high tumor burden. We conclude that a dual BH3-mimetic approach is highly effective in diverse models of high-risk human B-ALL and warrants assessment in clinical trials that incorporate tumor lysis precautions.</span></div></label></td>\

Although the efficacy of TKIs is beyond dispute, conception-related safety issues are still waiting to be explored, particularly in males. This systematic review aimed to summarize all available evidence on pregnancy outcomes of female spouses of male CML patients who fathered children after TKI treatment for CML.We performed a systematic search in seven electronic databases for studies that reported on male CML patients who did or did not discontinue TKI treatment before conceiving, and the pregnancy outcomes of their female spouse are available. The search centered on the TKI era (from 2001 onward) without any other language or study design restrictions.Out of a total of 38 potentially eligible papers, 27 non-overlapping study cohorts were analyzed. All were descriptive studies (case or case series studies). Altogether, 428 pregnancies from 374 fathers conceived without treatment discontinuation, 400 of which (93.5%) ended up in a live birth. A total of ten offspring with a malformation (2.5%) were reported: six with imatinib (of 313 live births, 1.9%), two with nilotinib (of 26 live births, 7.7%), one with dasatinib (of 43 live births, 2.3%), and none with bosutinib (of 12 live births). Data on CML status were scarcely reported. Only nine pregnancies (from nine males) and no malformation were reported in males who discontinued TKI treatment before conception.Malformations affected, on average 2.5% of live births from fathers who did not discontinue TKI treatment before conception, which is comparable with the rate of malformations in the general population. Large-scale studies with representative samples are awaited to confirm our results.</span></div></label></td>\

However, cardiotoxicity associated with these targeted therapies puts the cancer survivors at higher risk. Ponatinib is a third-generation TKI for the treatment of CML patients having gatekeeper mutation T315I, which is resistant to the first and second generation of TKIs, namely, imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib. Multiple unbiased screening from our lab and others have identified ponatinib as most cardiotoxic FDA approved TKI among the entire FDA approved TKI family (total 50+). Indeed, ponatinib is the only treatment option for CML patients with T315I mutation. This review focusses on the cardiovascular risks and mechanism/s associated with CML TKIs with a particular focus on ponatinib cardiotoxicity. We have summarized our recent findings with transgenic zebrafish line harboring BNP luciferase activity to demonstrate the cardiotoxic potential of ponatinib. Additionally, we will review the recent discoveries reported by our and other laboratories that ponatinib primarily exerts its cardiotoxicity via an off-target effect on cardiomyocyte prosurvival signaling pathways, AKT and ERK. Finally, we will shed light on future directions for minimizing the adverse sequelae associated with CML-TKIs.</span></div></label></td>\

Language of publications was restricted in English and Chinese.Prospective and retrospective comparative studies were included.Two authors independently assessed and extracted data. Quality of studies was assessed by the Cochrane Collaborations tool and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Subgroup analysis was performed by comparing different types of TKIs. Quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.Two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and four cohort studies enrolling 536 patients were included. For RCTs, the pooled HR was 0.68 (95% CI 0.26 to 1.78) in overall survival (OS), 0.63 (95% CI 0.28 to 1.42) in event-free survival (EFS), respectively, comparing TKI arm with non-TKI arm for treatment of paediatric Ph+ALL. There was significant difference in OS and EFS between imatinib arm and dasatinib arm (HR 2.26, 95%CI 1.02 to 5.01; HR 2.36; 95%CI 1.27 to 4.39, respectively). For cohort studies, the pooled HR was 0.25 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.47) in OS, 0.25 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.56) in EFS, respectively, comparing TKI arm with non-TKI arm. There was no significance difference in adverse drug reaction between TKI group and without TKI group (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95%CI 0.63 to 1.08 in RCT; RR 1.01, 95%CI 0.64 to 1.59 in cohort studies; respectively), and imatinib versus dasatinib (RR 0.97, 95%CI 0.77 to 1.23). The quality of evidence was rated as low for OS, EFS and adverse drug reaction (ADR).The combination of TKIs with chemotherapy is likely to improve the OS and EFS rates in paediatric Ph+ALL, and dasatinib is superior than imatinib. Large sample size and prospective controlled studies are warranted.CRD42018104107.</span></div></label></td>\

This systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) compares the efficacy and safety of imatinib vs second-generation (dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib) and third-generation TKIs (ponatinib) in adults with newly diagnosed Ph+ CP CML, concentrating on OS, progression-free survival (PFS), and hematological and nonhematological adverse events. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method. Seven RCTs published between 1990 and 2019 (involving 3262 participants) satisfied the eligibility criteria. Two RCTs (imatinib vs nilotinib and imatinib vs dasatinib) found no difference in 5-year OS or PFS. Second- and third-generation TKIs improved 3-month major molecular responses (relative risk [RR], 4.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.20-8.32) and other efficacy outcomes, decreased accelerated/blastic-phase transformations (RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.26-0.74), but were associated with more cases of thrombocytopenia (RR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.20-2.05), cardiovascular events (RR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.49-4.33), and pancreatic (RR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.32-3.96) and hepatic effects (RR, 3.51; 95% CI 1.55-7.92). GRADE showed that the certainty of the evidence ranged from high to moderate. This study shows that, in comparison with imatinib, second- and third-generation TKIs improve clinical responses, but the safer toxicity profile of imatinib may make it a better option for patients with comorbidities.</span></div></label></td>\

Quercetin (QUE) is one of the approved senolytic agents. In this study, we evaluated the protective effects of QUE on IDD development and its underlying mechanism.Effects of senolytic agent QUE on the viability of nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) were measured by CCK-8 assays and EdU staining. The senescence associated secreted phenotype (SASP) factors expressions were measured by qPCR, western blot, and ELISA; and NF-B pathway was detected by immunofluorescence and western blot. Molecular docking was applied to predict the interacting protein of QUE; while Nrf2 was knocked down by siRNAs to confirm its role in QUE regulated senescence phenotype. X-ray, MRI, Hematoxylin-Eosin and Safranin O-Fast green staining were performed to evaluate the therapeutic effects of QUE on IDD in the puncture-induced rat model.In in vitro experiments, QUE inhibited SASP factors expression and senescence phenotype in IL-1-treated NPCs. Mechanistically, QUE suppressed IL-1 induced activation of the NF-B pathway cascades; it was also demonstrated in molecular docking and knock down studies that QUE might bind to Keap1-Nrf2 complex to suppress NF-B pathway. In vivo, QUE ameliorated the IDD process in the puncture-induced rat model.Together the present work suggests that QUE inhibits SASP factors expression and senescence phenotype in NPCs and ameliorates the progression of IDD via the Nrf2/NF-B axis, which supports senolytic agent QUE as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of IDD.</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">With numerous new chemicals introduced into the environment everyday, identification of their potential hazards to the environment and human health is a considerable challenge. Developing adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework is promising in helping to achieve this goal as it can bring InVitro testing into toxicity measurement and understanding. To explore the toxic mechanism underlying environmental chemicals via the AOP approach, an integration of adequate experimental data with systems biology understanding is preferred. Here, we describe a novel method to develop reliable and sensible AOPs that relies on chemical-gene interactions, toxicity pathways, molecular regulations, phenotypes, and outcomes information obtained from comparative toxicogenomics database (CTD) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Using Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), a highly studied chemical as a stressor, we identified the pivotal IPA toxicity pathways, the molecular initiating event (MIE), and candidate key events (KEs) to structure AOPs in the liver and lung, respectively. Further, we used the corresponding CTD information of multiple typical AHR-ligands, including 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzoparadioxin (TCDD), valproic acid, quercetin, and particulate matter, to validate our AOP networks. Our approach is likely to speed up AOP development as providing a time- and cost-efficient way to collect all fragmented bioinformation in published studies. It also facilitates a better understanding of the toxic mechanism of environmental chemicals, and potentially brings new insights into the screening of critical paths in the AOP network.</span></div></label></td>\

There are many cases of acute pancreatitis (AP) caused by chemotherapeutic agents that have been reported. However, few reports focus on the combination of chemotherapeutic agents that induce acute pancreatitis. This article aims to retrospectively analyze a case of DIP and to explore the relationship between chemotherapeutic agents and acute pancreatitis.Here, we report a 35-year-old Chinese female patient who was diagnosed as acute myeloid leukemia with BCR/ABL expression. After induction chemotherapy of daunorubicin and cytarabine, bone marrow aspiration showed: Acute myeloid leukemia-not relieved (AML-NR). Then the regimen of homoharringtonine, cytarabine and dasatinib was started. The patient developed abdominal pain on the 14th day of chemotherapy. Laboratory tests showed elevated serum amylase (AMY) and lipase (LIPA). Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed a swollen pancreas with blurred edges and thickened left prerenal fascia.The patient was diagnosed as DIP by the symptoms of upper abdominal pain and the change of CT images. Other common causes of AP were excluded meanwhile.The chemotherapy was stopped immediately. And after fasting, fluid infusion and inhibiting the secretion of the pancreas, the symptoms were relieved.DIP relapsed when the regimen of aclacinomycin + cytarabine + G-CSF + dasatinib regimen (G-CSF (400ug/day, day 1 to 15), cytarabine (30mg/day, day 2 to 15), aclacinomycin (20mg/day, day 2 to 5)and dasatinib (140mg/day, continuously)) was given, and was recovered after treatment for AP was performed.To choose the best treatment plan for patients, clinicians should raise awareness of DIP, and should know that chemotherapeutic agents can induce pancreatitis and the combination of chemotherapeutic agents may increase the risk of drug-induced pancreatitis.</span></div></label></td>\

It can occur with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) but comparative real-world analyses on the incidence and complication rates are scarce. We retrospectively reviewed all cancer patients treated with TKI therapy at Mayo Clinic between January 2005 and December 2018 and had at least two ECGs (before and after TKI). For each TKI type, we determined the administration rate and incidence of QTc prolongation. QTc prolongation was defined as a corrected QT interval (by Fridericia formula)450ms in men and 470ms in women. A total of 618 cancer patients were included with 902 TKI administrations, of which 654 (72.5%) were accounted for by pazopanib, sunitinib, imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib. QTc prolongation (any grade) was reported in 28.8%, most commonly with nilotinib (38.7%) and dasatinib (41.7%). A QTc interval500ms and a QTc increase 60ms was documented in 46 and 63 administrations, respectively. Life-threatening toxicity was seen in 14 cases (5.4% of QTc prolongation cases) including VT in 9, SCD in 3 and TdP in two administrations. The response to QTc prolongation was: discontinuation in 68%, dose reduction in 13.5%, temporary hold in 8.1% and no action in 10.4%. In conclusion, QTc prolongation with TKI therapy is very common (1/3 of cases) and in 5% (1.7% overall) associated with life-threatening complications. These data support recommendations for careful ECG monitoring in cancer patients undergoing TKI therapy.</span></div></label></td>\

Given the short time frame from leukemia treatment to PCR positivity and the low case rate in mid-June in New York City, reinfection appears to have been unlikely and SARS-CoV-2 reactivation is a possible explanation. This case illustrates the risks of treating recently recovered COVID-19 patients with immunosuppressive therapy, particularly lymphocyte- and antibody-depleting therapy, and raises new questions about the potential of SARS-CoV-2 reactivation.</span></div></label></td>\

Pharmacological compounds that stabilize the visual receptor rhodopsin and modulate the cellular pathways triggering death of photoreceptors could avert this pathology. Interestingly, flavonoids can modulate the cellular processes, such as oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, and apoptosis, that are activated during retinal degeneration. As we found previously, flavonoids also bind directly to unliganded rod opsin, enhancing its folding, stability, and regeneration. In addition, flavonoids stimulate rhodopsin gene expression.

Here we examined the mechanism of inhibition of enzymes involved in uric acid metabolism by quercetin, conjugates and microbial catabolites, and measured the effect of lowered circulating uric acid on endothelial cell gene expression.Inhibition of adenosine deaminase (ADA), purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) and xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) activity by quercetin and metabolites was determined by HPLC. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured under conditions mimicking blood flow, treated with uric acid (0, 300 or 500mol/L), and changes in gene expression measured using transcriptomics and quantitative droplet digital PCR.In human plasma, no inhibition of PNP activity was observed, and only quercetin weakly inhibited ADA. XOR was not present at sufficient amount in human plasma to use for testing, but quercetin, quercetin-3-sulfate and the gut microbial metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid inhibited bovine milk XOR. Several changes were observed in gene expression in HUVECs under flow compared to static conditions, but after uric acid treatment, only very few changes were detected.We propose that the main mechanism by which quercetin, as quercetin-3-sulfate, lowers uric acid in vivo is through inhibition of XOR, and not ADA nor PNP. The pertinent shift in uric acid concentration was not sufficient to produce significant changes in endothelial gene expression in a cell model.</span></div></label></td>\

Here we show that cell-free mitochondrial DNA (cf-mt-DNA) released by senescent cells accumulates with aging and augments immunogenicity. Ischemia reperfusion injury induces a systemic increase of cf-mt-DNA that promotes dendritic cell-mediated, age-specific inflammatory responses. Comparable events are observed clinically, with the levels of cf-mt-DNA elevated in older deceased organ donors, and with the isolated cf-mt-DNA capable of activating human dendritic cells. In experimental models, treatment of old donor animals with senolytics clear senescent cells and diminish cf-mt-DNA release, thereby dampening age-specific immune responses and prolonging the survival of old cardiac allografts comparable to young donor organs.

Discontinuation of TKIs is safe and is associated with the successful achievement of treatment-free remission (TFR) for some patients.To evaluate molecular recurrence (MRec) and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) after TKI discontinuation for US patients with CML.The Life After Stopping TKIs (LAST) study was a prospective single-group nonrandomized clinical trial that enrolled 172 patients from 14 US academic medical centers from December 18, 2014, to December 12, 2016, with a minimum follow-up of 3 years. Participants were adults with chronic-phase CML whose disease was well controlled with imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, or bosutinib. Statistical analysis was performed from August 13, 2019, to March 23, 2020.Discontinuation of TKIs.Molecular recurrence, defined as loss of major molecular response (BCR-ABL1 International Scale ratio >0.1%) by central laboratory testing, and PROs (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System computerized adaptive tests) were monitored. Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) was performed on samples with undetectable BCR-ABL1 by standard real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR).Of 172 patients, 89 were women (51.7%), and the median age was 60 years (range, 21-86 years). Of 171 patients evaluable for molecular analysis, 112 (65.5%) stayed in major molecular response, and 104 (60.8%) achieved TFR. Undetectable BCR-ABL1 by either ddPCR or RQ-PCR at the time of TKI discontinuation (hazard ratio, 3.60; 95% CI, 1.99-6.50; P<.001) and at 3 months (hazard ratio, 5.86; 95% CI, 3.07-11.1; P<.001) was independently associated with MRec. Molecular recurrence for patients with detectable BCR-ABL1 by RQ-PCR was 50.0% (14 of 28), undetectable BCR-ABL1 by RQ-PCR but detectable by ddPCR was 64.3% (36 of 56), and undetectable BCR-ABL1 by both ddPCR and RQ-PCR was 10.3% (9 of 87) (P.001). Of the 112 patients in TFR at 12 months, 90 (80.4%) had a clinically meaningful improvement in fatigue, 39 (34.8%) had a clinically meaningful improvement in depression, 98 (87.5%) had a clinically meaningful improvement in diarrhea, 24 (21.4%) had a clinically meaningful improvement in sleep disturbance, and 5 (4.5%) had a clinically meaningful improvement in pain interference. Restarting a TKI resulted in worsening of PROs.In this study, TKI discontinuation was safe, and 60.8% of patients remained in TFR. Discontinuation of TKIs was associated with improvements in PROs. These findings should assist patients and physicians in their decision-making regarding discontinuation of TKIs. Detectable BCR-ABL1 by RQ-PCR or ddPCR at the time of TKI discontinuation was associated with higher risk of MRec; clinical application of this finding should be confirmed in other studies.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02269267.</span></div></label></td>\

As a result, it was found that quercetin could improve spatial learning and memory impairment displayed by aging mice in the Morris water maze.

It has also been suggested to prolong the lifespan of, and enhance heat-stress tolerance in nematodes; thus, the present study investigated its effects on both the nematode life- and health span by assessing its capacity to promote nematode motility after aging and/or heat stress, as well as the mechanisms underlying these effects. The results of the conducted analyses showed that quercetin feeding prolonged lifespan, suppressed age-related motility retardation, improved motility recovery after heat stress, and decreased the production of both intercellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in the analysed Caenorhabditis elegans strains, likely by modulating the insulin-like signalling (ILS) pathway and p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In particular, the transcription factors DAF-16 and SKN-1 were found to mediate the observed quercetin-induced effects, consistent with their previously demonstrated roles as regulators of aging. Furthermore, we demonstrated, for the first time, that quercetin induced heat-stress tolerance in C. elegans by modulating HSF-1 expression and/or activity.

However, the prognostic impact of comorbidities in patients with CML-CP treated with a second-generation TKI (2GTKI) has not been elucidated. We evaluated the effect of comorbidities on survival using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) in patients with CML-CP treated with imatinib or a 2GTKI (nilotinib and dasatinib). From April 2010 to March 2013, 506 patients with CML-CP were registered for the population-based cohort study, and 452 with a median age of 56 y were assessable. Treatment groups included 139 patients receiving imatinib, 169 receiving nilotinib, and 144 receiving dasatinib. Comorbidities were diagnosed in 99 patients. CCI scores were stratified as follows: 2, 353 patients; 3, 72 patients; and4, 27 patients. Treatment response did not vary relative to CCI scores. However, across the entire cohort, the OS rate was significantly lower among patients with higher CCI scores than in those with a CCI score of 2 (94.4% in score 2, 89.0% in score 3, and 72.8% in score4; P<.001). Multivariate analysis identified a CCI score of4 as a strong adverse prognostic factor for OS rather than the disease-specific risk factor, older age, performance status, or selection of TKI (Wald test, P<.01). Our results demonstrated that comorbidities at diagnosis were the most important predictive factor for successful treatment, regardless of the TKI type used in CML-CP.

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Chronic myeloid leukaemia is in principle a treatable malignancy but drug resistance is lowering survival. Recent drug discoveries have opened up new options for drug combinations, which is a concept used in other areas for preventing drug resistance. Two of these are (I) Axitinib, which inhibits the T315I mutation of BCR-ABL1, a main source of drug resistance, and (II) Asciminib, which has been developed as an allosteric BCR-ABL1 inhibitor, targeting an entirely different binding site, and as such does not compete for binding with other drugs. These drugs offer new treatment options.We measured the proliferation of KCL-22 cells exposed to imatinib-dasatinib, imatinib-asciminib and dasatinib-asciminib combinations and calculated combination index graphs for each case. Moreover, using the median-effect equation we calculated how much axitinib can reduce the growth advantage of T315I mutant clones in combination with available drugs. In addition, we calculated how much the total drug burden could be reduced by combinations using asciminib and other drugs, and evaluated which mutations such combinations might be sensitive to.Asciminib had synergistic interactions with imatinib or dasatinib in KCL-22 cells at high degrees of inhibition. Interestingly, some antagonism between asciminib and the other drugs was present at lower degrees on inhibition. Simulations revealed that asciminib may allow for dose reductions, and its complementary resistance profile could reduce the risk of mutation based resistance. Axitinib, however, had only a minor effect on T315I growth advantage.Given how asciminib combinations were synergistic in vitro, our modelling suggests that drug combinations involving asciminib should allow for lower total drug doses, and may result in a reduced spectrum of observed resistance mutations. On the other hand, a combination involving axitinib was not shown to be useful in countering drug resistance.</span></div></label></td>\

It has been shown that certain compounds in diet can generate beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease due to its interactions with endothelial cells. Thus, this review is aimed at investigating whether certain polyphenols present in the Mediterranean diet, specifically catechin, quercetin, resveratrol, and urolithin, could exert positive effects on endothelial dysfunction. After analysis of numerous papers, we found that polyphenols aiding endothelial function is beneficial not only for patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or endothelial dysfunction but for all people as it can improve the effects of aging on the endothelia. The additional benefit of these polyphenols on weight loss further improves health and lowers the risk of several diseases, including those caused by endothelial dysfunction. However, it is important to note that the dosages in the majorities of the studies mentioned in this review were of supplemental rather than nutritionally relevant quantities, and therefore, the recommended dosages are difficult to determine.</span></div></label></td>\

Bioactive phytochemicals could represent a natural alternative to ensure active aging and slow onset of neurodegenerative diseases in elderly patients.

Overall, 2420 patients were analyzed over a period of 6years. One hundred and fifty-seven patients (16.3%) treated with dasatinib and 164 treated with nilotinib (11.3%) have switched to another drug, with an overall frequency of 13.2%. In the dasatinib cohort, 39.4% of patients changed treatment for failure and 36.3% for intolerance as compared to 45.7% and 27.4% respectively in the nilotinib cohort. Overall, the median time to switch due to resistance was 293days, whereas it was 317days in case of intolerance. Resistance was observed mainly in younger male patients with high-risk features, while intolerance was not related to any baseline parameter. After resistance/intolerance to nilotinib, the majority of patients switched to dasatinib (53.8%) whereas in case of frontline dasatinib to ponatinib (43.2%). To the best of our knowledge these data provide the first report on the frequency of discontinuation of frontline 2gen TKIs and on the main causes and pattern of choice to a second-line therapy in the real-life setting.</span></div></label></td>\

All received imatinib as the initial TKI; 8% switched to nilotinib due to lack of major molecular response (MMR) to imatinib and 3% switched to dasatinib because of progression to blast crisis or lack of MMR. At the end of the study all patients had achieved at least a complete cytogenetic response.

We evaluated the 1-year cost-effectiveness of TKI initiation with imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib among a hypothetical cohort of incident patients with CML from a US payers perspective.We constructed a decision analytic model to assess quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), healthcare costs, net monetary benefit, and incremental cost-effectiveness of treatment strategies. We used published studies and data from the IBM Watson Health MarketScan database for model parameters. To calculate TKI costs, we used the 2018 Federal Supply Schedule estimates for generic imatinib and branded second-generation TKIs. We evaluated cost-effectiveness under various willingness-to-pay thresholds. We accounted for uncertainty with deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.In the base-case analysis, imatinib was favored over dasatinib and nilotinib at a lower cost per QALY gained. Imatinib remained the favored strategy after 1-way variations in TKI costs, TKI switching, QALYs, adverse event risk, and CML progression. When we assessed model uncertainty with prespecified parameter distributions, imatinib was cost-saving compared with dasatinib in 40% of 1000000 simulations and was favored over all simulations compared with nilotinib. First-line treatment with second-generation TKIs was cost-effective in 50% of simulations at a $200000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold.Generic availability of imatinib provides a more cost-effective treatment approach in the first year compared with other available TKIs for newly diagnosed patients with CML.</span></div></label></td>\

Previous studies have demonstrated that quercetin can disaggregate some amyloid fibrils, such as amyloid  peptide (A) and -synuclein. However, the disaggregating ability is unclear in PrP fibrils. In this study, we examined the amyloid fibril-disaggregating activity of quercetin on mouse prion protein (moPrP) and characterized quercetin-bound moPrP fibrils by imaging, proteinase resistance, hemolysis assay, cell viability, and cellular oxidative stress measurements. The results showed that quercetin treatment can disaggregate moPrP fibrils and lead to the formation of the proteinase-sensitive amorphous aggregates. Furthermore, quercetin-bound fibrils can reduce the membrane disruption of erythrocytes. Consequently, quercetin-bound fibrils cause less oxidative stress, and are less cytotoxic to neuroblastoma cells. The role of quercetin is distinct from the typical function of antiamyloidogenic drugs that inhibit the formation of amyloid fibrils. This study provides a solution for the development of antiamyloidogenic therapy.</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Quercetin is a naturally occurring polyphenol flavonoid which is rich in antioxidants. It has anti-allergic functions that are known for inhibiting histamine production and pro-inflammatory mediators. Quercetin can regulate the Th1/Th2 stability, and decrease the antigen-specific IgE antibody releasing by B cells. Quercetin has a main role in anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory function which makes it proper for the management of different diseases. Allergic diseases are a big concern and have high health care costs. In addition, the use of current therapies such as 2-agonists and corticosteroids has been limited for long term use due to their numerous side effects. Since the effect of quercetin on allergic diseases has been widely studied, in the current article, we review the effect of quercetin on allergic diseases, such as allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis (AR), and atopic dermatitis (AD).</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the treatment of choice for chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), can cause lower gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity which is manifested as diarrhoea. The mechanisms are not fully understood. The enteroendocrine signalling compound, serotonin (5-HT), is important for regulating peristaltic motion, fluid secretion and visceral hypersensitivity in the GI tract, and has been implicated in diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome. In this study, we have evaluated whether TKI-induced diarrhoea may be related to variation in the serotonin re-uptake transporter (SERT) gene. CML patients with and without diarrhoea on the SPIRIT2 trial (imatinib, n=319; and dasatinib, n=297) were genotyped for the promoter 5-HTTLPR, intron 2 VNTR and rs25531 polymorphisms by PCR-based methods. Diarrhoea was more prevalent in imatinib, than in dasatinib treated patients (P=0.015), which when stratified by gender was seen to be driven by female patients (P=0.036). Logistic regression analysis revealed that age, and the dominant HTTLPR with the rs25531 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) model, explained the occurrence of diarrhoea in ~10% of imatinib-treated female CML patients. These data suggest SERT polymorphisms influence imatinib-induced diarrhoea but not that of dasatinib.</span></div></label></td>\

Although the process of thrombogenesis is intimately related to cardiovascular disease risk, it is unclear whether quercitrin plays a role in thrombogenesis.The aim of this study was to examine the antiplatelet effect of quercitrin in platelet activation.Platelet aggregation, granule secretion, calcium mobilization, and integrin activation were used to assess the antiplatelet activity of quercitrin. Antithrombotic effect was determined in mouse using ferric chloride (FeClQuercitrin significantly impaired collagen-related peptide-induced platelet aggregation, granule secretion, reactive oxygen species generation, and intracellular calcium mobilization. Outside-in signaling of IIb3 integrin was significantly inhibited by quercitrin in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect of quercitrin resulted from inhibition of the glycoprotein VI-mediated platelet signal transduction during cell activation. Further, the antioxidant effect is derived from decreased phosphorylation of components of the TNF receptor-associated factor 4/p47Our results demonstrated that quercitrin could be an effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of thrombotic diseases.</span></div></label></td>\

One of the developed strategies to attenuate DOX toxicity is the combined therapy with bioactive compounds such as flavonoids. This review embraces the role of flavonoids on DOX treatment side effects. Protective properties of some flavonoidss against DOX toxicity have been investigated and observed mainly in heart but also in liver, kidney, brain, testis or bone marrow. Protective mechanisms involve reduction of oxidative stress by decrease of ROS levels and/or increase antioxidant defenses and interferences with autophagy, apoptosis and inflammation. Studies in cancer cells have reported that the anticancer activity of DOX was not compromised by the flavonoids.

Surgical resection remains the only curative approach for CRC, but recurrence following surgery is the main problem and ultimate cause of death. Lycopodium clavatum and quercetin have been found to exert its anticancer properties. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether quercetin or L. clavatum extract and combination of both have any profound role in reducing major inflammatory cytokines in Colo-320 cells. Methods L. clavatum and Quercetin alone or in combination was administered to colon cancer cells and various toxicity markers, gene expression analyses of apototic genes and gelatin zymmography were performed. Results Quercetin (50 m) in combination with L. clavatum extract (10 L) distinctly reduced cell growth and highlighted their potential effects in extirpation of colon cancer cells. Treatment with increased dose of L. clavatum extract in combination with quercetin reduced the colony size and proliferation potential when compared to the sole treatment of plant extracts. In the antimicrobial assays, it was observed that Lycopodium alone exhibited antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Characterization of L. clavatum extract and quercetin was performed and confirmed the presence of flavonoids and alkaloids. Treatment with Lycopodium and quercetin combination induced significant down-regulation in activities of MMP2 and MMP9 tested by gelatin zymography. The combined treatment greatly affected the mRNA expression of p53, Bcl2, Bax, Caspase 3, Wnt 1, Cyclin D1, and Catalase genes in colon cancer cells. Conclusion The synergistic effect between Lycopodium and quercetin might bring forward the enhanced antitumorigenic properties of combinational therapy with natural products to successfully combat the cancer progression with minimal side effects and resistance to drugs.</span></div></label></td>\

Currently, five TKIs (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib and ponatinib) are approved for the treatment of CML and can be used as first, second or further lines of treatment according to disease risk scores, patient comorbidities and the presence of known TKI resistance mechanisms. In fact, 15-20% of all CML patients fail to achieve optimal responses according to the current definitions of the European Leukemia Network and will require sequential TKI treatment to avoid disease progression.

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Emerging evidence implicates accelerated renal tubular epithelial cell (RTEC) senescence in renal fibrosis progression. Mitophagy protects against kidney injury. However, the mechanistic interplay between cell senescence and mitophagy in RTECs is not clearly defined. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the inhibition of RTEC senescence and renal fibrosis by quercetin and explore the underlying mechanisms. We found that quercetin attenuated RTEC senescence induced by angiotensin II (AngII) in vitro and unilateral ureteral obstruction in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrated that mitochondrial abnormalities such as elevated reactive oxygen species, decreased membrane potential, and fragmentation and accumulation of mitochondrial mass, occurred in AngII-treated RTECs. Quercetin treatment reversed these effects. Furthermore, quercetin enhanced mitophagy in AngII-treated RTECs, which was markedly reduced by treatment with mitophagy-specific inhibitors. Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) was involved in quercetin-mediated PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1)/Parkin-associated mitophagy activation. Pharmacological antagonism of SIRT1 in AngII-treated RTECs blocked the effects of quercetin on mitophagy and cellular senescence. Finally, quercetin alleviated kidney fibrosis by reducing RTEC senescence via mitophagy. Collectively, the antifibrotic effect of quercetin involved inhibition of RTEC senescence, possibly through activation of SIRT1/PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. These findings suggest that pharmacological elimination of senescent cells and stimulation of mitophagy represent effective therapeutic strategies to prevent kidney fibrosis.</span></div></label></td>\

A cross-sectional and observational study was conducted of 37 patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia receiving dasatinib or nilotinib after imatinib failure. Left ventricular systolic functions were evaluated using four-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography derived global longitudinal (GLS), circumferential (GCS), radial (GRS), and area (GAS) strain indices. Mean ejection fraction, stroke volume, cardiac output and left ventricular mass index were similar between control and patient groups and within normal limits. GLS (-16.7% vs -20.8%, p<0.001), GCS (-13.0% vs -15.6%, p=0.002), and GAS (-26.2% vs -31.0, p<0.001) values were significantly higher in the patient population than those of the controls. Dasatinib and nilotinib groups did not show differences regarding strain indices. In multivariate regression analysis, only the usage of dasatinib or nilotinib was found to be an independent risk factor for diminished GAS (=4.406, p=0.016), GLS (=3.797, p=0.001), and GCS (=2.404, p=0.040). Although imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib seem to be clinically safe in terms of cardiac function, monitoring of systolic functions using strain imaging, and long-term observation of patients may provide early detection of the possible cardiac toxicity.</span></div></label></td>\

Effective target therapy for renal injury has yet been developed. Besides, potential anti-COVID-19 medicines have also been reported to cause adverse side effects to kidney. Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM), however, has rich experience in treating renal injury and has successfully applied in China in the battle of COVID-19. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms of CHM treatment are still unclear. In this study, we searched prescriptions in the treatment of renal injury extensively and the potential mechanisms to treat COVID-19 related renal injury were investigated. The association rules analysis showed that the core herbs includes Huang Qi, Fu Ling, Bai Zhu, Di Huang, Shan Yao. TCM herbs regulate core pathways, such as AGE-RAGE, PI3K-AKT, TNF and apoptosis pathway, etc. The ingredients (quercetin, formononetin, kaempferol, etc.,) from core herbs could modulate targets (PTGS2 (COX2), PTGS1 (COX1), IL6, CASP3, NOS2, and TNF, etc.), and thereby prevent the pharmacological and non-pharmacological renal injury comparable to that from COVID-19 infection. This study provides therapeutic potentials of CHM to combat COVID-19 related renal injury to reduce complications and mortality.</span></div></label></td>\

However, this condition has lacked adequate attention; thus, to develop effective control measures, we determined ringworm prevalence, risk factors, and the direct-sample nested PCR diagnostic indices compared with the conventional methods of dermatophytes identification. Moreover, the phenolic composition of an Aloe vera gel extract (AGE) and its in vitro and in vivo antidermatophytic activity were evaluated and compared with those of antifungal drugs.Of the 760 calves examined, 55.79% (424/760) showed ringworm lesions; 84.91% (360/424) were positive for fungal elements in direct-microscopy, and 79.72% (338/424) were positive in culture. Trichophyton verrucosum was the most frequently identified dermatophyte (90.24%). The risk of dermatophytosis was higher in 4-6-month-old vs. 1-month-old calves (60% vs. 41%), and in summer and winter compared with spring and autumn seasons (66 and 54% vs. 48%). Poor hygienic conditions, intensive breeding systems, animal raising for meat production, parasitic infestation, crossbreeding, and newly purchased animals were statistically significant risk factors for dermatophytosis. One-step PCR targeting the conserved regions of the 18S and 28S genes achieved unequivocal identification of T. verrucosum and T. mentagrophytes in hair samples. Nested-PCR exhibited an excellent performance in all tested diagnostic indices and increased the species-specific detection of dermatophytes by 20% compared with culture. Terbinafine and miconazole were the most active antifungal agents for dermatophytes. Gallic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, cinnamic acid, aloe-Emodin, quercetin, and rutin were the major phenolic compounds of AGE, as assessed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). These compounds increased and synergized the antidermatophytic activity of AGE. The treated groups showed significantly lower clinical scores vs. the control group (P<0.05). The calves were successfully treated with topical AGE (500ppm), resulting in clinical and mycological cure within 14-28days of the experiment; however, the recovery was achieved earlier in the topical miconazole 2% and AGE plus oral terbinafine groups.The nested PCR assay provided a rapid diagnostic tool for dermatophytosis and complemented the conventional methods for initiating targeted treatments for ringworm in calves. The recognized antidermatophytic potential of AGE is an advantageous addition to the therapeutic outcomes of commercial drugs.</span></div></label></td>\

Limited clinical evidence suggests that supplemental quercetin may decrease risk for upper respiratory infections in humans. Quercetin and enzymatically-modified isoquercitrin (EMIQ - a food additive/nutraceutical that upon oral administration achieves far higher plasma concentrations of quercetin than quercetin per se) also have exerted a range of vascular-protective effects clinically and in rodents - improving endothelial function, warding off atherosclerosis, lowering blood pressure, decreasing C-reactive protein, aiding glycemic control, stabilizing platelets - that might also, at least in part, reflect CK2 inhibition.

Interpheron &#945; and bone marrow transplantation used to be the main treatment modalities for patients with CML 20 years ago. Due to the introduction of imatinib mesylate since the year 2000 the outcome of CML patients has dramatically improved. The survival of both younger and elderly patients in the case of an optimal response has been prolonged and currently is close to survival of healthy population. Although, one third of patients does not respond well to first line imatinib and needs to change the treatment to second line tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI: bosutinib, dasatinib and nilotinib). Younger patients without cardiologic and metabolic disorders and those with poor risk profile score may have benefit from TKI of 2nd generation as a 1st line treatment option with the aim of reaching deeper molecular response and the chance of treatment free remission (TFR) in future. By older patients with severe comorbidities and in patients with good risk profile score imatinib as a 1st line treatment option can be used. For patients who are resistant simultaneously to 2nd generation TKI and for patients with mutation T315I ponatinib - TKI of 3rd generationcan be used effectively. Intolerance and toxicity of TKIs are the main barriers of effective CML treatment. TKI selection for each patient should be individual. Patients cooperation with medical team is crucial and inevitable in long time treatment process. The chance for TFR has become feasible for approximately 40-60 % CML patients in deep and durable molecular remission and represents a further important milestone in the management of CML patients.</span></div></label></td>\

In this study, we used db/db mice to investigate whether quercetin could activate SIRT1 and inhibit ER pathways to improve DE. Behavioral tests (Morris water maze and new objects) showed that quercetin (70 mg/kg) can effectively improve the learning and memory ability in db/db mice. OGTT and ITT tests indicated that quercetin could alleviate impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in db/db mice. Western blot analysis and Nissl staining showed that quercetin can improve the expression of nerve and synapse-associated proteins (PSD93, PSD95, NGF and BDNF) and inhibit neurodegeneration. Meanwhile, quercetin up-regulates SIRT1 protein expression and inhibits the expression of ER signaling pathway-related proteins (PERK, IRE-1, ATF6, eIF2, BIP and PDI). In addition, oxidative stress levels were significantly reduced after quercetin treatment. In conclusion, current experimental results indicated that SIRT1/ER stress is a promising mechanism involved in quercetin-treated diabetic encephalopathy.</span></div></label></td>\

Furthermore, fenitrothion provoked many histopathological changes in the foetal liver and markedly up-regulated the mRNA gene expression of p53, caspase-9 along with elevation in the immunoreactivity of Bax and caspase-3, but it down-regulated the expression level of paraoxonase-1. Remarkably, quercetin co-treatment successfully ameliorated the hepatic oxidative injury and apoptosis prompted by fenitrothion.Dietary supplements with quercetin can be used to reduce the risk from organophosphorus exposure probably through paraoxonase-1 up-regulation and enhancement of the cellular antioxidant system.</span></div></label></td>\

Children with ETV6-RUNX1 or hyperdiploid > 50 ALL who achieve negative minimal residual disease during early remission induction are suitable candidates for reduction in treatment. Patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive or Ph-like ALL with ABL-class fusion should be treated with dasatinib.

There are other fusions or mutations that may serve as putative targets, but effective targeted therapy has yet to be established. For other high-risk patients or poor early treatment responders who do not have targetable genetic lesions, current approaches that offer hope include blinatumomab, inotuzumab and CAR-T cell therapy for B-ALL, and daratumumab and nelarabine for T-ALL.

Quercetin is a well-known flavonoid whose antiviral properties have been investigated in numerous studies. There is evidence that vitamin C and quercetin co-administration exerts a synergistic antiviral action due to overlapping antiviral and immunomodulatory properties and the capacity of ascorbate to recycle quercetin, increasing its efficacy. Safe, cheap interventions which have a sound biological rationale should be prioritized for experimental use in the current context of a global health pandemic.

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a worldwide health problem with growing up rates of mortality and morbidity. Many risk factors, including high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia are responsible for CVD. CVD can be prevented by some simple and cost-effective steps such as smoking cessation, normalizing body weight, regular physical activity, and dietary changes, including decreasing saturated fats, increasing the intake of vegetables and fruits, and reducing sugar intake. In the last decades, growing up number of studies were performed to explain the possible function of non-nutrient substances from the diet which might prevent CVD. One of these natural compounds is quercetin which is widely present in vegetables, tea, fruits and wine. Many in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies have indicated the cardioprotective functions of quercetin. They can be explained by quercetins reducing blood pressure, antioxidant potential and some other activities. This review evaluates the experimental and clinical studies that have studied the effect of quercetin in CVD and summarizes the molecular mechanisms of action as well as clinical effects of quercetin in CVD.</span></div></label></td>\

Understanding human skin aging requires in-depth knowledge of the molecular and functional properties of various skin cell types. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of human eyelid skin from healthy individuals across different ages and identified eleven canonical cell types, as well as six subpopulations of basal cells. Further analysis revealed progressive accumulation of photoaging-related changes and increased chronic inflammation with age. Transcriptional factors involved in the developmental process underwent early-onset decline during aging. Furthermore, inhibition of key transcription factors HES1 in fibroblasts and KLF6 in keratinocytes not only compromised cell proliferation, but also increased inflammation and cellular senescence during aging. Lastly, we found that genetic activation of HES1 or pharmacological treatment with quercetin alleviated cellular senescence of dermal fibroblasts. These findings provide a single-cell molecular framework of human skin aging, providing a rich resource for developing therapeutic strategies against aging-related skin disorders.</span></div></label></td>\

In spite of extensive research the therapeutics options of disease are limited which only offer symptomatic relief and could not prevent the disease progression. Therefore researchers are looking for the probable synthetic or natural compounds for the PD therapeutics. Due to mandatory chronic consumption of anti PD drug to the PD patients, the natural compounds are getting attention recently. Numerous studies have indicated the neuroprotective effects of natural polyphenols including epigallocatechin, quercetin, baicalein, resveratrol, luteolin, curcumin, puerarin, genistein, hyperoside naringin against dopaminergic neuronal death with relatively safe with uncommon, mild or transient side effects. However, their mechanistic interference in dopaminergic neuronal death mechanism is not very well defined. Herein, we have attempted to discuss the various natural polyphenols with their known effects on various PD related pathologies to understand their therapeutic utilization for PD patients either in prophylactic or therapeutic mode. Briefly we have also discussed the major disease mechanisms which could be targeted for utilization of these polyphenols specifically involving oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. We have also discuss the limitation and probable strategies for the clinical utilization of these polyphenols for the benefit of PD patients.</span></div></label></td>\

Currently, there is no permanent cure to the disease, but it can be managed with several potent drugs that cause serious side effects on prolonged use. Traditional remedies are considered promising for the treatment of several diseases, particularly chronic conditions, because they have lower side effects compared to synthetic drugs. In folklore, the rhizome of Alpinia calcarata Roscoe (Zingiberaceae) is used as a major ingredient of herbal formulations to treat RA. Phytoconstituents reported in A. calcarata rhizomes are diterpenoids, sesquiterpenoid, flavonoids, phytosterol, and volatile oils. The present study is intended to understand the molecular-level interaction of phytoconstituents present in A. calcarata rhizomes with RA molecular targets using computational approaches. A total of 30 phytoconstituents reported from the plant were used to carry out docking with 36 known targets of RA. Based on the docking results, 4 flavonoids were found to be strongly interacting with the RA targets. Further, molecular dynamics simulation confirmed stable interaction of quercetin with 6 targets (JAK3, SYK, MMP2, TLR8, IRAK1, and JAK1), galangin with 2 targets (IRAK1 and JAK1), and kaempferol (IRAK1) with one target of RA. Moreover, the presence of these three flavonoids was confirmed in the A. calcarata rhizome extract using LC-MS analysis. The computational study suggests that flavonoids present in A. calcarata rhizome may be responsible for RA modulatory activity. Particularly, quercetin and galangin could be potential development candidates for the treatment of RA.

A chronic inflammatory state is also associated with aging. Tart cherry (TC) has been extensively studied for its ability to prevent or treat inflammatory diseases and their associated risk factors. TC contains active compounds, including polyphenols that may contribute to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Inflammatory signaling pathways regulate the recruitment of inflammatory cells important for the pathogenesis of disease. Whole TC, individual compounds, and their metabolites may be viable treatment options because they can target molecules involved in inflammatory pathways. In this review, the effectiveness of TC in reducing inflammatory markers associated with chronic diseases and the effects of the active compounds in TC and their metabolites on inflammatory pathways are discussed. The main polyphenols present in TC include cyanidins, kaempferol, quercetin, melatonin, neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid, and 3-coumaroylquinic acid. Evidence supports an association between TC intake and reduced risk for inflammatory disease, which may be due to the effects of active compounds in TC on inflammatory pathways, such as NF-B and mitogen-activated protein kinase.</span></div></label></td>\

This study evaluated transcriptomic and morphological responses of two teosinte (Zea mays ssp parviglumis) (an ancestor of domesticated maize) lines (Ames 21812 and Ames 21789) to weed presence and absence during two growing seasons. Responses were compared after 6 weeks of growth in Aurora, South Dakota, USA. Plant heights between treatments were similar in Ames 21812, whereas branch number decreased when weeds were present. Ames 21789 was 45% shorter in weedy vs weed-free plots, but branch numbers were similar between treatments. Season-long biomass was reduced in response to weed stress in both lines. Common down-regulated subnetworks in weed-stressed plants were related to light, photosynthesis, and carbon cycles. Several unique response networks (e.g. aging, response to chitin) and gene sets were present in each line. Comparing transcriptomic responses of maize (determined in an adjacent study) and teosinte lines indicated three common gene ontologies up-regulated when weed-stressed: jasmonic acid response/signaling, UDP-glucosyl and glucuronyltransferases, and quercetin glucosyltransferase (3-O and 7-O). Overall, morphologic and transcriptomic differences suggest a greater varietal (rather than a conserved) response to weed stress, and implies multiple responses are possible. These findings offer insights into opportunities to define and manipulate gene expression of several different pathways of modern maize varieties to improve performance under weedy conditions.</span></div></label></td>\

Protein hydroperoxides, formed by photosensitized oxidation, mediated by RPBP, were analyzed in cells and in a model system with bovine serum albumin (BSA), using the coumarin boronic acid fluorogenic probe. The effect of photic stress on specific phagocytosis of RPE cells was determined by flow cytometry. Photoreactivity of POS with and without quercetin was analyzed by EPR oximetry and EPR spin trapping. Cytotoxicity measurements and MMP analyses confirmed that supplementation with quercetin protected ARPE-19 cells against photic stress mediated by rhodopsin-rich POS. Quercetin significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of RPBP-mediated stress on POS phagocytosis and the RPBP ability to photooxidize cellular proteins or BSA. The data support the hypothesis that quercetin may efficiently diminish the phototoxic action of retinoids, necessary for restoring the phagocytic function of ARPE-19 cells.</span></div></label></td>\

According to reports, cytokine storm is strongly responsible for death in such patients. Some of the consequences of severe inflammation and cytokine storms include acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute lung injury, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. Phylogenetic findings show more similarity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with bat coronaviruses, and less with SARS-CoV. Quercetin is a carbohydrate-free flavonoid that is the most abundant flavonoid in vegetables and fruits and has been the most studied to determine the biological effects of flavonoids. Inflammasomes are cytosolic multi-protein complexes assembling in response to cytosolic PAMP and DAMPs, whose function is to generate active forms of cytokines IL-1 and IL-18. Activation or inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome is affected by regulators such as TXNIP, SIRT1 and NRF2. Quercetin suppresses the NLRP3 inflammasome by affecting these regulators. Quercetin, as an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, analgesic and inflammatory compound, is probably a potential treatment for severe inflammation and one of the main life-threatening conditions in patients with COVID-19.</span></div></label></td>\

The current study investigates the extent to which quercetin (Q) and chrysin (CH) protect against vascular dysfunction in MetS rats. MetS was induced by feeding rats a high-salt diet (3%) and fructose-enriched water (10%) for 12 weeks. Thoracic aorta was isolated from MetS rats and from control rats, with the latter being injured by methylglyoxal (MG). Aortae were incubated with CH and Q, and vascular reactivity was evaluated through the analysis of aortic contraction and relaxation in response to PE and ACh, respectively. The formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and the free radical scavenging activity of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) were also evaluated following the introduction of CH and Q. The increased vasoconstriction and impaired vasodilation in MetS aortae were significantly ameliorated by Q and CH. Similarly, they ameliorated glycation-associated exaggerated vasoconstriction and impaired vasodilation produced by MG in control aortae. In addition, both Q and CH were effective in reducing the formation of AGEs and inhibition of glycosylation in response to MG or fructose treatment. Finally, Q successfully scavenged DPPH free radicals while CH showed significant vasodilation of precontracted aorta that was inhibited by L-NAME. In conclusion, Q and CH provide protection against vascular dysfunction in MetS by interfering with AGEs formations and AGEs-associated vascular deterioration, with CH being largely dependent on NO-mediated mechanisms of vasodilation.</span></div></label></td>\

This study aimed to screen the key targets of SBD in adverse-risk AML using the drug-biomarker interaction model through bioinformatics and network pharmacology methods. First, the adverse-risk AML-related critical biomarkers and targets of SBD active ingredient were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and several pharmacophore matching databases. Next, the protein-protein interaction network was constructed, and topological analysis and pathway enrichment were used to screen key targets and main pathways of intervention of SBD in adverse-risk AML. Finally, molecular docking was implemented for key target verification. The results suggest that luteolin and quercetin are the main active components of SBD against adverse-risk AML, and affected drug resistance, apoptosis, immune regulation and angiogenesis through the core targets AKT1, MAPK1, IL6, EGFR, SRC, VEGFA and TP53. We hope the proposed drug-biomarker interaction model provides an effective strategy for the research and development of antitumour drugs.</span></div></label></td>\

Rat BMSCs were isolated and identified by immunofluorescence and multilineage differentiation assay. Quercetin was used to clean senescent BMSCs. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony formation assay was used to evaluate the cellular proliferation. While the cellular migration was detected by the scratch wound healing assay and transwell assay.

The mechanism of CKD post-AKI, characterized by progressive renal fibrosis, is still unclear. Maladaptive tubular epithelial cells (TECs) after AKI are considered a leading cause of renal fibrosis post-AKI. TECs under maladaptive repair manifest characteristics of senescence. Removing senescent TECs by genetic ablation has been proven effective in reducing renal fibrosis. Senolytics, which eliminate senescent cells by pharmacological intervention, have been studied in a series of degenerative diseases. To our knowledge, the effects of senolytics on renal fibrosis post-AKI have not been verified before. Here, we confirmed renal senescence in the unilateral ischemia/reperfusion injury murine model. Senescent TECs could activate fibroblasts and senolytics specifically induced apoptosis of senescent TECs. Next, we demonstrated that senolytics could reduce renal senescence and ameliorate renal fibrosis in both unilateral renal ischemia/reperfusion injury and multiple-cisplatin-treatment murine models. Our results indicate senescent TECs as a vital factor in renal fibrosis progression, and senolytic therapy might be promising for treating CKD post-AKI.</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common chronic liver diseases worldwide, as it affects up to 30 % of adults in Western countries. Moreover, NAFLD is also considered an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Insulin resistance and inflammation have been identified as key factors in the pathophysiology of NAFLD. Although the mechanisms associated with the development of NAFLD remain to be fully elucidated, a complex interaction between adipokines and cytokines appear to play a crucial role in the development of this condition. Adiponectin is the most common adipokine known to be inversely linked with insulin resistance, lipid accumulation, inflammation and NAFLD. Consequently, the focus has been on the use of new therapies that may enhance hepatic expression of adiponectin downstream targets or increase the serum levels of adiponectin in the treatment NAFLD. While currently used therapies show limited efficacy in this aspect, accumulating evidence suggest that various dietary polyphenols may stimulate adiponectin levels, offering potential protection against the development of insulin resistance, inflammation and NAFLD as well as associated conditions of metabolic syndrome. As such, this review provides a better understanding of the role polyphenols play in modulating adiponectin signaling to protect against NAFLD. A brief discussion on the regulation of adiponectin during disease pathophysiology is also covered to underscore the potential protective effects of polyphenols against NAFLD. Some of the prominent polyphenols described in the manuscript include aspalathin, berberine, catechins, chlorogenic acid, curcumin, genistein, piperine, quercetin, and resveratrol.</span></div></label></td>\

We formed a steering committee, a consensus panel, a consultants group and an evidence synthesis team to guide the development of the guideline. We formulated the clinical questions through two rounds of survey, and finally selected five questions. We then systematically searched the related evidence and conducted meta-analyses, evidence summaries and GRADE decision tables to draft the recommendations, which the consensus panel then voted on using the Delphi method. Finally, we formulated six recommendations based on the evidence synthesis and experts consensus. For treating mild influenza, we suggest either Lianhua Qingwen capsule, Jinhua Qinggan granule, Banlangen granule, Shufeng Jiedu capsule, or Jinfang Baidu pill, depending on the manifestations. For severe influenza, or mild influenza in patients at high risk of developing severe influenza, we suggest Lianhua Qingwen capsule in combination with antiviral medications and supportive therapy. The strength of all recommendations was weak.

Herein, we introduce novel flavones (TVF), which were characterized as 3-caffeoylquinic acid, 5-caffeoylquinic acid, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside, and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside by UPLC-MS/MS, derived from the vine of Tetrastigma hemsleyanum (TV), a traditional Chinese herb and food. TVF exhibited outstanding anti-cancer abilities at the in vitro and in vivo level, and markedly triggered apoptosis via the Bax/Bcl-2/caspase-9/caspase-3 pathway. The intrinsic mechanism study illustrated that TVF might induce apoptosis by activating autophagy by inhibiting the Akt-mTOR pathway, and the main component of TVF, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside, enabled THR308 site binding to block the phosphorylation of Akt, which was further evidenced by molecular docking computation. Our study reveals the excellent anti-cancer ability and inner mechanism of TVF, suggesting TVF as a potential candidate for clinical drug exploitation or dietary supplementation in cancer medication and prevention, providing a promising strategy for cancer chemotherapy.</span></div></label></td>\

FBP1 is universally silenced in both human and murine liver tumours. Hepatocyte-specific Fbp1 deletion results in steatosis, concomitant with activation and senescence of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), exhibiting a senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Depleting senescent HSCs by senolytic treatment with dasatinib/quercetin or ABT-263 inhibits tumour progression. We further demonstrate that FBP1-deficient hepatocytes promote HSC activation by releasing HMGB1; blocking its release with the small molecule inflachromene limits FBP1-dependent HSC activation, the subsequent development of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype and tumour progression.

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Obesity is one of the growing public health problems in Turkey, as well as all over the world, threatening people of almost all ages. Turkey has a large potential for research on this topic due to owning broad ethnomedicinal experience and the richest flora (34% endemic) of Europe and the Middle East. Herbs that they have utilized for centuries to treat and prevent obesity can provide useful options to overcome this issue.This survey was carried out to disclose the inventory of plant taxa that the people of Turkey have been using for a few centuries in treating obesity without any side effects or complications, and to compare them with experimental studies in the literature.The research was achieved in two phases on the matter above by using electronic databases, such as Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Scopus, ProQuest, Medline, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, HighWire Press, PubMed and Google Scholar. Both results were shown in separate tables as well as the regional comparative analysis.117 herbal taxa belonging to 45 families were identified among the selected 74 studies conducted in the seven regions of Turkey. However, only 49 (41.9%) of them were found to be subjected to worldwide in vitro and in vivo research conducted on anti-obesity activity. Quercetin (9.1%), gallic acid (6.1%) and ferulic acid and epigallocatechin gallate (4.5%) have been recorded as the most common active ingredients among the 66 active substances identified. Prunus avium (32.4%) and Rosmarinus officinalis (25.7%) were identified as the most common plants used in Turkey. Also, Portulaca oleracea and Brassica oleracea emerged as the most investigated taxa in the literature.This is the first country-wide ethnomedical review conducted on obesity treatment with plants in Turkey. Evaluating the results of the experimental anti-obesity research conducted in the recent years in the literature, it was determined that forty-nine plants were verified. This clearly shows that these herbs have a high potential to be a pharmacological resource. Moreover, 68 (41.9%) taxa, which havent been investigated yet, are likely to be a promising resource for national and international pharmacological researchers in terms of new natural medicine searches.</span></div></label></td>\

At present, postoperative platinum drugs and paclitaxel-based chemotherapy is the gold standard treatment for ovarian cancer. However, patients who receive this chemotherapy often develop cumulative toxic effects and are prone to chemotherapy resistance. Therefore, it is necessary to determine more effective treatment options that would be better tolerated by patients. Recent studies have reported the therapeutic effects of numerous natural products in patients with ovarian cancer. Notably, these natural ingredients do not induce adverse effects in healthy cells and tissues, suggesting that natural products may serve as a safe alternative treatment for ovarian cancer. The antitumor effects of natural products are attributed to suppression of cell proliferation and metastasis, stimulation of autophagy, improved chemotherapy sensitivity, and induction of apoptosis. The present review focused on the antitumor effects of several natural products, including curcumin, resveratrol, ginsenosides, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate and quercetin, which are increasingly being investigated as therapeutic options in ovarian cancer, and discussed the molecular mechanisms involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, metastasis and sensitization.</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">In the early twenty-first century, societies around the world are facing the paradoxal epidemic development of PCa as a non-communicable disease. PCa is the most frequently diagnosed cancer for men in several countries such as the USA. Permanently improving diagnostics and treatments in the PCa management causes an impressive divergence between, on one hand, permanently increasing numbers of diagnosed PCa cases and, on the other hand, stable or even slightly decreasing mortality rates. Still, aspects listed below are waiting for innovate solutions in the context of predictive approaches, targeted prevention and personalisation of medical care (PPPM / 3PM).A.PCa belongs to the cancer types with the highest incidence worldwide. Corresponding economic burden is enormous. Moreover, the costs of treating PCa are currently increasing more quickly than those of any other cancer. Implementing individualised patient profiles and adapted treatment algorithms would make currently too heterogeneous landscape of PCa treatment costs more transparent providing clear "road map" for the cost saving.B.PCa is a systemic multi-factorial disease. Consequently, predictive diagnostics by liquid biopsy analysis is instrumental for the disease prediction, targeted prevention and curative treatments at early stages.C.The incidence of metastasising PCa is rapidly increasing particularly in younger populations. Exemplified by trends observed in the USA, prognosis is that the annual burden will increase by over 40% in 2025. To this end, one of the evident deficits is the reactive character of medical services currently providedto populations. Innovative screening programmes might be useful to identify persons in suboptimal health conditions before the clinical onset of metastasising PCa. Strong predisposition to systemic hypoxic conditions and ischemic lesions (e.g. characteristic for individuals with Flammer syndrome phenotype) and low-grade inflammation might be indicative for specific phenotyping and genotyping in metastasising PCa screening and disease management. Predictive liquid biopsy tests for CTC enumeration and their molecular characterisation are considered to be useful for secondary prevention of metastatic disease in PCa patients.D.Particular rapidly increasing PCa incidence rates are characteristic for adolescents and young adults aged 15-40 years. Patients with early onset prostate cancer pose unique challenges; multi-factorial risks for these trends are proposed. Consequently, multi-level diagnostics including phenotyping and multi-omics are considered to be the most appropriate tool for the risk assessment, prediction and prognosis. Accumulating evidence suggests that early onset prostate cancer is a distinct phenotype from both aetiological and clinical perspectives deserving particular attention from view point of 3P medical approaches.</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Xanthine oxidase (EC 1.17.3.2) (XO) is one of the main enzymatic sources that create reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the living system. It is a dehydrogenase enzyme that performs electron transfer to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+ ), while oxidizing hypoxanthin, which is an intermediate compound in purine catabolism, first to xanthine and then to uric acid. XO turns into an oxidant enzyme that oxidizes thiol groups under certain stress conditions in the tissue. The last metabolic step, in which hypoxanthin turns into uric acid, is catalyzed by XO. Uric acid, considered a waste product, can cause kidney stones and gouty-type arthritis as it is crystallized, when present in high concentrations. Thus, XO inhibitors are one of the drug classes used against gout, a purine metabolism disease that causes urate crystal storage in the joint and its surroundings caused by hyperuricemia. Urate-lowering therapy include XO inhibitors that reduce uric acid production as well as uricosuric drugs that increase urea excretion. Current drugs that obstruct uric acid synthesis through XO inhibition are allopurinol, febuxostat, and uricase. However, since the side effects, safety and tolerability problems of some current gout medications still exist; intensive research is ongoing to look for new, effective, and safer XO inhibitors of natural or synthetic origins for the treatment of the disease. In the present review, we aimed to assess in detail XO inhibitory capacities of pure natural compounds along with the extracts from plants and other natural sources via screening Pubmed, Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, and Google Academic. The data pointed out to the fact that natural products, particularly phenolics such as flavonoids (quercetin, apigenin, and scutellarein), tannins (agrimoniin and ellagitannin), chalcones (melanoxethin), triterpenes (ginsenoside Rd and ursolic acid), stilbenes (resveratrol and piceatannol), alkaloids (berberin and palmatin) have a great potential for new XO inhibitors capable of use against gout disease. In addition, not only plants but other biological sources such as microfungi, macrofungi, lichens, insects (silk worms, ants, etc) seem to be the promising sources of novel XO inhibitors.</span></div></label></td>\

Characterization of the flavosomes was conducted in terms of their vesicle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency and deformability index. Ex vivo skin permeation and confocal laser scanning microscopy studies demonstrated that the flavosome formulations improved the skin permeation of meloxicam compared to that for transfersomes.

Coumarins and their derivatives exert a vast array of bioactive properties such as anticoagulant, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumor, antiviral, and enzyme inhibition. Higher doses of coumarin are found to be hepatotoxic however they exhibit beneficial effects by reducing the risk of cancer and other neuronal and cardiovascular ailments. Most of these effects can be attributed to their free radical scavenging effects. Coumarins such as umbelliferone, esculetin and quercetin show antioxidant properties and protect the cellular DNA from oxidative damage. The dicumarol shows anticoagulant properties by inhibiting the action of vitamin K, whereas angelmarin has been reported to be cytotoxic in pancreatic cancer. Coumarins also reduce edema and inflammation by inhibiting the prostaglandins biosynthesis. Hydroxyl aromatic substituted derivatives such as 5-hydroxycoumarin or vicinal dihydroxy coumarins have also been found to be potent anti-inflammatory agents. Some coumarins are approved by the FDA as drugs, and warfarin is one such example. It blocks the Vitamin K reductase enzyme thus disrupting the clotting mechanism. In conclusion, the coumarin class of phytomolecules has a lot of potential to be used as drugs for various diseases. Much work is needed to bring them at the stage of clinical trials for further approval. There is a lot of hope for this unexplored area of translational research.</span></div></label></td>\

To predict novel TAO-specific therapeutic molecule, structure-based drug design (SBDD) was performed.We observed gene expression and pathway analysis and SBDD approaches might bring new insights in the field of TAO pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment. A genome-wide map of human genetic interactions revealed involvement of crucial cell-signalling pathways, such as TNF-mediated signalling pathway, type-I interferon signalling pathway, toll-like receptor signalling pathway, transforming growth factor-beta receptor signalling pathway etc. Recently, FDA-approved teprotumumab a breakthrough, first drug for the treatment of active thyroid eye disease, which reduces proptosis and the need for orbital decompression surgery. Furthermore, our SBDD results revealed that cost-effective Curcumin, Withaferin A, Resveratrol, Scopolamine, Quercetin, and Berberine may have significant binding affinity for hyaluronan protein and may be exploited for therapeutic purposes in TAO.Considering the increasing risk and nature of disease, novel drug therapies and markers for prognosis need to be investigated. Moreover, evidence-based non-invasive/minimal surgical therapies should be developed for the better management of the disease.ADIPOQ: Adiponectin; CAS: Clinical Activity Score; CCL5: C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 5; CT: Computed Tomography; DON: Dysthyroid Optic Neuropathy; EUGOGO: European Group of Graves Orbitopathy; FDA: U.S. Food and Drug Administration; FOS: Fos Proto-Oncogene, AP-1 Transcription Factor Subunit; HLA: Human Leukocyte Antigen; HLA-DRA: Major Histocompatibility Complex, Class II, DR Alpha; ICAM1: Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1; IFNG: Interferon Gamma; IGF-1: Insulin-like Growth Factor 1; IGF-1R: Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 Receptor; IL12B: Interleukin 12B; IL23R: Interleukin 23 Receptor; IL6: Interleukin 6; IOP: Intraocular Pressure; IRF1: Interferon Regulatory Factor 1; IRF5: Interferon Regulatory Factor 5; IRF7: Interferon Regulatory Factor 7; IRF9: Interferon Regulatory Factor 9; JUN: Jun Proto-Oncogene, AP-1 Transcription Factor Subunit; JUNB: JunB Proto-Oncogene, AP-1 Transcription Factor Subunit; MHC: Major Histocompatibility Complex; MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging; NFKB1: Nuclear Factor Kappa B Subunit 1; NFKBIA: Nuclear Factor Kappa B Inhibitor Alpha; OADSCs: Orbital Adipose Derived Stromal Cells; PDGFB: Platelet Derived Growth Factor Subunit B; PPARG: Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor Gamma; RANTES: Regulated on Activation Normal T cell Expressed and Secreted; RARA: Retinoic Acid Receptor Alpha; RCTs (Randomized Controlled Trials; SLE: Systemic lupus erythematosus; SOCS3: Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3; STAT1: Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1; TAO: Thyroid-Associated Ophthalmopathy; TED: Thyroid eye disease; TGFB1: Transforming Growth Factor Beta 1; TGFB2: Transforming Growth Factor Beta 2; TGF-: Transforming Growth Factor-beta; TLR7: Toll like Receptor 7; TLR9: Toll like Receptor 9; TNFRSF18: Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily Member 18; TNFSF11: Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily Member 11; TNF-: Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; TSHR: Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Receptor; TSIs: Thyroid Stimulating Immunoglobulin; WNT5A: Wingless-Type MMTV Integration Site Family, Member 5A.</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Plumeria rubra L. (Apocynaceae) is a deciduous, commonly ornamental, tropical plant grown in home premises, parks, gardens, graveyards, because of its beautiful and attractive flowers of various colours and size. The different parts of the plant are used traditionally to treat various diseases and conditions like leprosy, inflammation, diabetic mellitus, ulcers, wounds, itching, acne, toothache, earache, tongue cleaning, pain, asthma, constipation and antifertility.The main aim of this review is to provide an overview and critically analyze the reported ethnomedical uses, phytochemistry, pharmacological activities and toxicological studies of P. rubra and to identify the remaining gaps and thus supply a basis for further investigations. The review also focuses towards drawing attention of people and researchers about the wide spread pharmaceutical properties of the plant for its better utilization in the coming future.All the relevant data and information on P. rubra was gathered using various databases such as PubMed, Springer, Taylor and Francis imprints, NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information), Science direct, Google scholar, Chemspider, SciFinder, research and review articles from peer-reviewed journals and unpublished data such as Phd thesis, etc. Some other grey literature sources such as webpages, ethnobotanical books, chapters, wikipedia were also studied.More than 110 chemical constituents have been isolated from P. rubra including iridoids, terpenoids, flavonoids and flavonoid glycosides, alkaloids, glycosides, fatty acid esters, carbohydrates, animo acids, lignan, coumarin, volatile oils, etc. The important chemical constituents responsible for pharmacological activities of the plant are fulvoplumierin, plumieride, rubrinol, lupeol, oleanolic acid, stigmasterol, taraxasteryl acetate, plumieride-p-E-coumarate, rubranonoside, rubrajalellol, plumericin, isoplumericin, etc. The plant possess a wide range of pharmacological activities present namely antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, antidiabetic, hepatoprotective, anticancer, anthelmintic, antifertility and many other activities.P. rubra is a valuable medicinal source and further study in this topic can validate the traditional and ethnobotanical use of the plant. However, many aspects of the plant have not been studied yet. The pharmacological activity of active chemical constituent isolated from the plant is proven only for a couple of activities hence, lack of bio-guided isolation strategies is observed. Further studies on bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, mechanism of action and structural activity relationship studies of isolated pure compounds will contribute more in understanding their pharmacological effects. Higher doses of plant extracts are administered to experimental animals, therefore their toxicity and side effects in humans are needed to be thoroughly studied, although no side effect or toxicity is seen or observed in experimental animals. Studies are also essential to investigate the long term in vivo toxicity and clinical efficacy of the plant.</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">The use of complementary and alternative medicine including herbal medicine (phytotherapy), vitamins, minerals and food supplements is frequent among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHAs) who take antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, but is often not known by their prescribing physicians. Some drug-supplement combinations may result in clinically meaningful interactions.In this literature review, we aimed to investigate the evidence for complementary and alternative medicine interactions with ARVs.A bibliographic search of all invitro, human studies and case reports of the PubMed database was performed to assess the risk of interactions between complementary and alternative self-medication products and ARVs. The HIV drug interaction (https://www.hiv-druginteractions.org) and Natural medicines comprehensive database (https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com) interaction checkers were also analysed.St Johns wort, some forms of garlic, grapefruit and red rice yeast are known to have significant interaction and thus should not be co-administered, or should be used with caution with certain ARV classes. Data on other plant-based supplements come from invitro studies or very small size invivo studies and are thus insufficient to conclude the real invivo impact in case of concomitant administration with ARVs. Some polyvalent minerals such as calcium, magnesium, and iron salts can reduce the absorption of integrase inhibitors by chelation. Potential interactions with vitamin C and quercetin with some ARVs should be noted and efficacy and tolerance of the treatment should be monitored.This review shows the importance of screening all PLWHAs for complementary and alternative medicine use to prevent treatment failure or adverse effects related to an interaction with ARVs. Further human studies are warranted to describe the clinical significance of invitro interactions between numerous complementary and alternative medicine and ARVs.</span></div></label></td>\

A successful strategy to combat the COVID-19 pandemic is the improvement of nutritional pattern. Garlic is one of the most efficient natural antibiotics against the wide spectrum of viruses and bacteria. Organosulfur (e.g., allicin and alliin) and flavonoid (e.g., quercetin) compounds are responsible for immunomodulatory effects of this healthy spice. The viral replication process is accelerated with the main structural protease of SARS-CoV-2. The formation of hydrogen bonds between this serine-type protease and garlic bioactives in the active site regions inhibits the COVID-19 outbreak. The daily dietary intake of garlic and its derived-products as an adjuvant therapy may improve side effects and toxicity of the main therapeutic drugs with reducing the used dose.</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (R-IRI) is the main cause of acute renal failure. Carvedilol has been shown to protect against R-IRI. However, the underlying mechanisms are still not completely clarified. This study aimed to investigate the role of lipid signaling in mediating carvedilol protective effects against R-IRI in insulin-resistant mice by using two different lipid signaling modulators, quercetin and lithium chloride (LiCl). Mice were fed high-fructose, high-fat diet (HFrHFD) for 16 weeks to induce insulin resistance. At the end of feeding period, mice were randomly distributed into five groups; Sham, R-IRI, Carvedilol (20mg/kg, i.p.), Carvedilol+Quercetin (10mg/kg, i.p.), Carvedilol+LiCl (200mg/kg, i.p.). R-IRI was performed by applying 30min of unilateral renal ischemia followed by one hour of reperfusion. Quercetin and LiCl were administered 30min before carvedilol administration and carvedilol was administered 30min before ischemia. Changes in kidney function tests, histopathology, fibrosis area, lipid signaling, inflammatory, apoptosis and oxidative stress markers in the kidney were measured. Results showed that R-IRI decreased kidney function, impaired renal tissue integrity, modulated lipid signaling and increased renal inflammation, apoptosis and oxidative stress. Carvedilol treatment decreased the detrimental effects induced by R-IRI. In addition, pre-injection of both quercetin and LiCl potentiated the reno-protective effects of carvedilol against R-IRI independent of changes in lipid mediators like phosphatidyl inositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2) and diacylglycerol (DAG). In conclusion, quercetin and LiCl potentiate the protective effects of carvedilol against R-IRI in HFrHFD-fed mice by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress independent of lipid signaling.</span></div></label></td>\

The formulation composition of hydrogel and its preparation method were optimized to have a high swelling ratio and drug content. Quercetin (QCT) and quetiapine (QTP), as an HAase inhibitor and model drug, respectively, were incorporated into the cross-linked hydrogel using the antisolvent precipitation method for extending their release after subcutaneous injection. The cross-linked HA (cHA)-based hydrogels displayed appropriate viscoelasticity and injectability for subcutaneous injection. The incorporation of QCT (as an HAase inhibitor) in the cHA hydrogel formulation resulted in slower in vitro and in vivo degradation profiles compared to the hydrogel without QCT. Single dosing of optimized hydrogel injected via a subcutaneous route in rats did not induce any acute toxicities in the blood chemistry and histological staining studies. In the pharmacokinetic study of rats following subcutaneous injection, the cHA hydrogel with QCT exhibited a lower maximum QTP concentration and longer half-life and mean residence time values compared to the hydrogel without QCT. All of these results support the designed HAase inhibitor-incorporated cHA hydrogel being a biocompatible subcutaneous injection formulation for sustained drug delivery.</span></div></label></td>\

Moreover, obesity induces chronic inflammation in adipose tissue, liver, skeletal muscle, and the vascular system. Quercetin is the major representative of the flavonoid subclass of flavonols, which is ubiquitously contained within natural plants such as green tea, and vegetables, including onions and apples. Researchers have focused greater attention to the beneficial physiological roles of quercetin, which has anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic effects on insulin resistance and atherosclerosis in obesity-related diseases. Also, the anti-inflammatory effects of quercetin on intestinal microbiota have been demonstrated in obesity. In addition, there is increasing evidence that quercetin is associated with epigenetic activities in cancer, and in maternal undernutrition during gestation and lactation. In this review, we focus on the chemical properties of quercetin, its dietary sources in obesity, and its anti-inflammatory effects on insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, intestinal microbiota, and maternal under-nutrition with epigenetic activity.</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have features such as the ability to self-renew, differentiate into defined progenies and initiate the tumor growth. Treatments of cancer include drugs, chemotherapy and radiotherapy or a combination. However, treatment of cancer by various therapeutic strategies often fail. One possible reason is that the nature of CSCs, which has stem-like properties, make it more dynamic and complex and may cause the therapeutic resistance. Another limitation is the side effects associated with the treatment of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. To explore better or alternative treatment options the current study aims to investigate the natural drug-like molecules that can be used as CSC-targeted therapy. Among various natural products, anticancer potential of phenolics is well established. We collected the 21 phytochemicals from phenolic group and their interacting CSC genes from the publicly available databases. Then a bipartite graph is constructed from the collected CSC genes along with their interacting phytochemicals from phenolic group as other. The bipartite graph is then transformed into weighted bipartite graph by considering the interaction strength between the phenolics and the CSC genes. The CSC genes are also weighted by two scores, namely, DSI (Disease Specificity Index) and DPI (Disease Pleiotropy Index). For each gene, its DSI score reflects the specific relationship with the disease and DPI score reflects the association with multiple diseases. Finally, a ranking technique is developed based on PageRank (PR) algorithm for ranking the phenolics.We collected 21 phytochemicals from phenolic group and 1118 CSC genes. The top ranked phenolics were evaluated by their molecular and pharmacokinetics properties and disease association networks. We selected top five ranked phenolics (Resveratrol, Curcumin, Quercetin, Epigallocatechin Gallate, and Genistein) for further examination of their oral bioavailability through molecular properties, drug likeness through pharmacokinetic properties, and associated network with CSC genes.Our PR ranking based approach is useful to rank the phenolics that are associated with CSC genes. Our results suggested some phenolics are potential molecules for CSC-related cancer treatment.</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Mulberry (Morus alba) leaf is traditionally consumed as a functional tea with remedial effects, such as preventing aging-related diseases. Two similar compounds, quercetin 3-O-malonylglucoside, and kaempferol 3-O-malonylglucoside, were detected in mulberry leaves and found to be structural recombinant composites of teaghrelin and emoghrelin, two classes of non-peptidyl compounds functionally identified as analogs of ghrelin. Molecular modeling showed that these two mulberry compounds were able to enter and interact with the ghrelin receptor and theoretical calculation revealed that they were similar to emoghrelin but slightly weaker than teaghrelin in terms of interaction with the receptor. The relatively abundant compound, quercetin 3-O-malonylglucoside was subjected to a bioactivity assay, and the result confirmed that it was able to increase the growth hormone secretion of rat anterior pituitary cells. It seems that quercetin 3-O-malonylglucoside is also a functional analog of ghrelin and presumably a key ingredient for the anti-aging activity of mulberry leaves. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: According to this study, quercetin 3-O-malonylglucoside and kaempferol 3-O-malonylglucoside are suggested to serve as active ingredients in tea products prepared from mulberry leaves. Contents of these two compounds might be used as key factors for breeding or screening mulberry varieties for commercial cultivation. Moreover, water extract of mulberry leaves containing these compounds can be used as an adequate supplement for functional food.</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">There is a growing emphasis on the role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis as modulator of host behaviour and as therapeutic target for neuropsychiatric disorders. In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that early-life stress can exert long-lasting changes on the brain and microbiota, and this early adversity is associated with increased risk for developing depression in later life. The maternal separation (MS) model in rats is a robust paradigm to study the effects of early-life stress on the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Recently, we have shown that polyphenols, naturally occurring compounds associated with several health benefits, have anti-stress effects in in vitro models. In this study, we assess the therapeutic potential of a variety of both flavonoid and non-flavonoid polyphenols in reversing the impact of MS on behaviour and the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Rats underwent a dietary intervention with the naturally-derived polyphenols xanthohumol and quercetin, as well as with a phlorotannin extract for 8 weeks. Treatment with polyphenols prevented the depressive- and anxiety-like behaviours induced by MS, where xanthohumol effects were correlated with rescue of BDNF plasma levels. In addition, MS resulted in altered brain levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and dopamine, accompanied by abnormal elevation of plasma corticosterone. Although polyphenols did not reverse neurotransmitter imbalance, xanthohumol normalised corticosterone levels in MS rats. Finally, we explored the impact of MS and polyphenolic diets on the gut microbiota. We observed profound changes in microbial composition and diversity produced by MS condition and by xanthohumol treatment. Moreover, functional prediction analysis revealed that MS results in altered enrichment of pathways associated with microbiota-brain interactions that are significantly reversed by xanthohumol treatment. These results suggest that naturally-derived polyphenols exert antidepressant-like effects in MS rats, which mechanisms could be potentially mediated by HPA regulation, BDNF levels rescue and modulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis.</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Given the disadvantages and limitations of current endometriosis therapy, there is a progressive increase in studies focusing on plant-derived agents as a natural treatment option with the intention of achieving high efficiency, avoiding adverse effects and preserving the chance for successful pregnancy. The heterogeneity of these studies in terms of evaluated agents, applied approaches and outcomes illustrates the need for an up-to-date summary and critical view on this rapidly growing field in endometriosis research.This review provides a comprehensive overview of plant-derived agents and natural treatment strategies that are under preclinical or clinical investigation and critically evaluates their potential for future endometriosis therapy.An English language PubMed literature search was performed using variations of the terms endometriosis, natural therapy, herb/herbal, plant, flavonoid, polyphenol, phytochemical, bioactive, Kampo and Chinese medicine. It included both animal and human studies. Moreover, the Clinicaltrials.gov database was searched with the term endometriosis for clinical trials on plant-derived agents. No restriction was set for the publication date.Natural therapies can be assigned to three categories: (i) herbal extracts, (ii) specific plant-derived bioactive compounds and (iii) Chinese herbal medicine (CHM). Agents of the first category have been shown to exert anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic and anti-oxidant effects on endometrial cells and endometriotic lesions. However, the existing evidence supporting their use in endometriosis therapy is quite limited. The most studied specific plant-derived bioactive compounds are resveratrol, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, curcumin, puerarin, ginsenosides, xanthohumol, 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, quercetin, apigenin, carnosic acid, rosmarinic acid, wogonin, baicalein, parthenolide, andrographolide and cannabinoids, with solid evidence about their inhibitory activity in experimental endometriosis models. Their mechanisms of action include pleiotropic effects on known signalling effectors: oestrogen receptor-, cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-1 and -6, tumour necrosis factor-, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular endothelial growth factor, nuclear factor-kappa B, matrix metalloproteinases as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis-related proteins. Numerous studies suggest that treatment with CHM is a good choice for endometriosis management. Even under clinical conditions, this approach has already been shown to decrease the size of endometriotic lesions, alleviate chronic pelvic pain and reduce postoperative recurrence rates.The necessity to manage endometriosis as a chronic disease highlights the importance of identifying novel and affordable long-term safety therapeutics. For this purpose, natural plant-derived agents represent promising candidates. Many of these agents exhibit a pleiotropic action profile, which simultaneously inhibits fundamental processes in the pathogenesis of endometriosis, such as proliferation, inflammation, ROS formation and angiogenesis. Hence, their inclusion into multimodal treatment concepts may essentially contribute to increase the therapeutic efficiency and reduce the side effects of future endometriosis therapy.</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Cyclophosphamide (CPA) is used in the management of autoimmune conditions and malignant illnesses. However, its therapeutic use is limited because of its severe side effects, especially hepatotoxicity attributed to oxidative stress. Nasturtium officinale R. Br (watercress or WC) has pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammation, and antioxidant activities. Therefore, the present study was design to assess effects of WC or its active ingredient, quercetin (QE), against CPA-induced hepatotoxicity. For this study, 49 male Wistar rats (200-250g) were randomly selected and categorized into seven equal groups. The animals were pre- and post-treated with both hydroalcoholic extract of WC (500mg/kg) and quercetin (75mg/kg) for 10 consecutive days, and intraperitoneal administration of CPA (200mg/kg) was performed on only day 10, one hour before the last dose of WC or quercetin. On day 11, all the animals were sacrificed, and their blood and liver were gathered for evaluation of the liver enzyme, hepatic oxidative stress markers, antioxidant enzymes activity, and hematoxylin and eosin staining. CPA significantly increased malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl (PCO) and nitric oxide (NO) levels and liver biomarkers. Otherwise, hepatic catalase (CAT), reduced glutathione (GSH), total thiol content (tSH), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) were considerably lower than the control group. Results showed that WC has the ability to reduce the changes (MDA, PCO, FRAP, CAT, ALT and AST) and QE (MDA, PCO, AST) induced by CPA (p<0.05). Histopathological finding confirmed the indicated results. These findings propose that WC and QE have protective effect against the CPA-induced hepatotoxicity by decreasing oxidative stress.</span></div></label></td>\

To solve these issues, precision cancer nanomedicine based on natural therapeutic materials is developed, which enables specifically apoptosis by interacting with genetic mutation in cancer cells, while leaving normal cells unaffected. Here, we report a novel nanomedicine (CuQDA/IO@HA) composed of hyaluronic acid (HA) / copper ion (Cu(II))-chelated dextran-aldehyde (DA)-quercetin (Q) with dual targeting for synthetic lethal therapy. The CuQDA/IO@HA prepared using a ratio of metal/Q at 0.5:1 resulted in a stable particle structure with uniform particle distribution. The CuQDA/IO@HA can specifically target and induce specific cytotoxicity in BRCA-mutant cancer cells in vitro. Combination treatment with CuQDA/IO@HA and magnetic navigation can induce poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition and DNA damage in BRCA-mutant triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) via CD44 targeting. The dual-targeting CuQDA/IO@HA can extend the median survival of the BRCA-mutant xenograft mice from 34 to 61days in comparison to Q treatment alone in vivo, which is attributed to the significant increase in H2AX, leading to significant apoptosis. More importantly, the CuQDA/IO@HA displayed biocompatibility and no obvious side-effect in normal organs. These results demonstrate the promising potential of integrating natural and metal ions into a nanomedicine that can provide precision medicine through synthetic lethality.</span></div></label></td>\

MMPs play an important role in maintaining a normal physiological function and preventing diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Natural products derived from plants have been used as traditional medicine for centuries. Its active compounds, such as catechin, resveratrol and quercetin, are suggested to play an important role as MMPs inhibitors, thereby opening new insights into their applications in many fields, such as pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industries. This review summarises the current knowledge on plant-derived natural products with MMP-modulating activities. Most of the reviewed plant-derived products exhibit an inhibitory activity on MMPs. Amongst MMPs, MMP-2 and MMP-9 are the most studied. The expression of MMPs is inhibited through respective signalling pathways, such as MAPK, NF-B and PI3 kinase pathways, which contribute to the reduction in cancer cell behaviours, such as proliferation and migration. Most studies have employed in vitro models, but a limited number of animal studies and clinical trials have been conducted. Even though plant-derived products show promising results in modulating MMPs, more in vivo studies and clinical trials are needed to support their therapeutic applications in the future.</span></div></label></td>\

It is increasingly acknowledged that more informative in vitro tests using multiple endpoints may support the correct identification of carcinogenic potential. The present study, therefore, employed a holistic, multiple-endpoint approach using low doses of selected carcinogens and non-carcinogens (0.001-770M) to assess whether these chemicals caused perturbations in molecular and cellular endpoints relating to the Hallmarks of Cancer. Endpoints included micronucleus induction, alterations in gene expression, cell cycle dynamics, cell morphology and bioenergetics in the human lymphoblastoid cell line TK6.

There is a growing tendency for people to self-medicate with health supplements as they are generally considered safe, however clinical studies relating to their efficacy and safety are limited. This mixed-methods systematic review aims to synthesise the available evidence relating to the treatment of allergic rhinitis with a variety of health supplements. A total of 57 062 articles were derived from searching seven online databases and evidence from 48 RCTs and 10 observational studies were reviewed for methodological quality and risk of bias. No qualitative studies meeting the inclusion criteria could be found, therefore only a quantitative review was performed. Promising evidence for the following single supplements were found: apple polyphenols, tomato extract, spirulina, chlorophyll c2, honey, conjugated linoleic acid, MSM, isoquercitrin, vitamins C, D and E, as well as probiotics. Combination formulas may also be beneficial, particularly specific probiotic complexes, a mixture of vitamin D</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Atherosclerosis-related acute aortic syndromes, such as aortic aneurysms or aortic dissection are life-threatening diseases. Since they develop suddenly and progress rapidly, the establishment of preventive strategies is urgently needed. Quercetin, a flavonoid abundant in various vegetables and fruits, is suggested to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, in this study, the preventive effect of quercetin was evaluated using a mouse model of aortic aneurysm and dissection. The model was established by administering angiotensin II (Ang II) and -aminopropionitrile (BAPN), a lysyl oxidase inhibitor, to mice to induce hypertension and degeneration of the elastic lamina, which would eventually result in the onset of an aortic aneurysm. Ang II, BAPN, and a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor was administered to induce aortic dissection via endothelial dysfunction. Quercetin (60 mg/kg/day) was administered 2 weeks before inducing aortic diseases by the end of the experiments (8 weeks in the aneurysm model, 6 weeks in the dissection model). It was found to reduce the incidence of aneurysm (from 72 to 45%), dissection (from 17 to 10%), and rupture (from 33 to 15%) in mice. Elastin degradation was ameliorated in the quercetin-treated mice compared to that in the mice without quercetin treatment (degradation score 2.9  0.3 vs 2.2  0.2). Furthermore, quercetin suppressed the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, macrophage infiltration, and pro-matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity. Our results suggest that quercetin might prevent the onset of atherosclerosis-related acute aortic syndromes through its anti-inflammatory and endothelial cell-protective effects.</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Due to the outbreaks such as SARS, bird flu and swine flu, which we frequently encounter in our century, we need fast solutions with no side effects today more than ever. Due to having vast ethnomedical experience and the richest flora (34% endemic) of Europe and the Middle East, Turkey has a high potential for research on this topic. Plants that locals have been using for centuries for the prevention and treatment of influenza can offer effective alternatives to combat this problem. In this context, 224 herbal taxa belonging to 45 families were identified among the selected 81 studies conducted in the seven regions of Turkey. However, only 35 (15.6%) of them were found to be subjected to worldwide in vitro and in vivo research conducted on anti-influenza activity. Quercetin and chlorogenic acid, the effectiveness of which has been proven many times in this context, have been recorded as the most common (7.1%) active ingredients among the other 56 active substances identified.This study has been carried out to reveal the inventory of plant species that have been used in flu treatment for centuries in Turkish folk medicine, which could be used in the treatment of flu or flu-like pandemics, such as COVID 19, that humanity has been suffering with, and also compare them with experimental studies in the literature.The investigation was conducted in two stages on the subject above by using electronic databases, such as Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, Medline, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, HighWire Press, PubMed and Google Scholar. The results of both scans are presented in separate tables, together with their regional comparative analysis.Data obtained on taxa are presented in a table, including anti-influenza mechanism of actions and the active substances. Rosa canina (58.7%) and Mentha x piperita (22.2%) were identified as the most common plants used in Turkey. Also, Sambucus nigra (11.6%), Olea europaea (9.3%), Eucalyptus spp., Melissa officinalis, and Origanum vulgare (7.0%) emerged as the most investigated taxa.This is the first nationwide ethnomedical screening work conducted on flu treatment with plants in Turkey. Thirty-nine plants have been confirmed in the recent experimental anti-influenza research, which strongly shows that these plants are a rich pharmacological source. Also, with 189 (84.4%) taxa, detections that have not been investigated yet, they are an essential resource for both national and international pharmacological researchers in terms of new natural medicine searches. Considering that the production of antimalarial drugs and their successful use against COVID-19 has begun, this correlation was actually a positive and remarkable piece of data, since there are 15 plants, including Centaurea drabifolia subsp. Phlocosa (an endemic taxon), that were found to be used in the treatment of both flu and malaria.</span></div></label></td>\

Five experimental pre-treatment solutions were created using the following flavonoids: quercetin (QUE); hesperidin (HES); rutin (RUT); naringin (NAR), or proanthocyanidin (PRO). A placebo solution (PLA) with no flavonoids added was also evaluated. The flavonoids or placebo solutions were applied to the CAD prior to the application and photoactivation of a universal adhesive (Scotchbond Universal, 3M Oral Care). A control group (CON), in which only the bonding agent was applied without any flavonoid solution, was also evaluated. A 3-mm-thick block of resin composite (Opallis, FGM) was built up on the flat bonded CAD surfaces and was light-cured following the manufacturers instructions. Specimens were sectioned to obtain resin-dentin slices and sticks (cross-sectional area of 0.8 mmThe specimens from groups QUE, NAR, and RUT presented greater TBS values than those from CON group (p<0.05). Specimens from some of these experimental groups presented greater nanomechanical properties (p<0.05), and no morphological degradation at the resin-dentin interface after aging.The use of exogenous cross-linkers as dentin pre-treatment before bonding procedures may represent a suitable strategy to improve the longevity of universal adhesive systems applied to caries-affected dentin.</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Rilpivirine, a recently developed drug of choice for initial treatment of HIV-1 infection, can greatly reduce HIV-related inflammation, but in turn, may be associated with adverse secondary effects, including disturbances in lipid metabolism and ultimately in adipose tissue distribution and function. In recent years, research findings on the benefits of anti-oxidant foods and supplements have been employed in counter-acting both oxidative stress as well as inflammation in order to reduce the adverse side effects of anti-retroviral therapy. One such natural flavonoid which possesses anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties is quercetin. This study investigated the effect of quercetin in overcoming the side effects incurred due to rilpivirine administration. The results show substantial reduction in the accumulation of triglyceride levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner for adipose cells treated with either rilpivirine or quercetin alone and in combination, as evidenced by morphological pictures and quantitative measurement of triglycerides throughout the differentiation process. Levels of inflammatory markers such as resistin and IL-8 were increased as compared to the untreated cells. No significant changes in leptin were observed on treatment of adipose cells with rilpivirine alone and its levels were almost comparable to control. Levels of oxidative markers like superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione were also decreased. Treatment with quercetin showed a decrease in the inflammatory status and an increase in the oxidative status of adipose cells, thereby exhibiting its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. However, further assessment of lipid metabolism and adipose tissue function in patients administered with rilpivirine-based regimes is advisable considering that totally neutral effects of rilpivirine on lipid homeostasis cannot be anticipated from the current study in vitro. It is concluded that rilpivirine causes an anti-adipogenic and pro-inflammatory response pattern but only at high concentrations, whereas quercetin has been observed to decrease inflammation and restore the levels of anti-oxidant enzymes.</span></div></label></td>\

Therefore, the aim of the present investigation was to identify phytotherapeutics through assessment of the pharmacokinetic interaction of HU with dietary bioflavonoids followed by elucidation of the same phytoconstituents for their ability to protect HU-induced toxicity in hematological profile. In this direction, we developed a sensitive ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method to estimate HU in rat plasma at first and then validated as per USFDA guidelines as there is no such precedent in the literature. A simple plasma protein precipitation method was employed for plasma sample processing. The separation was achieved in gradient mode using Syncronis HILIC column (1004.6mm, 3m) with a mobile phase composition of water containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid and acetonitrile. Ionization was carried out in positive heated-electrospray ionization (H-ESI) mode. Detection was done in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode with m/z 77.1>44.4 and m/z 75.1>58.2 for HU and methylurea (internal standard), respectively. All the validation parameters were within the acceptable criteria. This bioanalytical method was found to be useful in assessing the preclinical pharmacokinetic interaction of HU. Concomitant administration of chrysin or quercetin with HU in rats significantly enhanced the oral exposure of HU. Lowering of total red blood cells (RBC) and hemoglobin (Hb) level by HU in rats was significantly improved in the presence of chrysin, quercetin, and naringenin. Overall, both chrysin and quercetin showed potential to be a promising phytotherapeutics for concomitant therapy with HU to combat its dose-dependent side effects.</span></div></label></td>\

The rapid spread of COVID-19 infection besides the lack of knowledge about any treatments and the growing concern of the public from the virus directed us toward writing this review article in an aim to provide alternatives to the allopathic medicine use. There is a wealth of chemical diversity in the naturally existing compounds, including their antiviral activities, which may encourage their utilization as therapeutics against viral infections, including coronaviruses. The majority of publications on the herbal remedies of coronavirus, MERS, or SARS focused primarily on the use of polar compounds. These substances displayed encouraging inhibitory influences on coronavirus in humans. These include psoralidin, scutellarein, silvestrol, tryptanthrin, caffeic acid, quercetin, myricetin, saikosaponin B2, griffithsin (lectins), and isobavachalcone. Some other agents like lycorine may be useful, if the antiviral activity is obtained by concentrations below the toxic plasma levels. According to the available literatures, the most promising inhibitors of coronaviruses are polyphenolic compounds, which are small molecules with conjugated fused ring structures.</span></div></label></td>\

The current aim was to explore the benefits of the oral PC administration on the intestinal barrier integrity in animals.The effects of PCs on the intestinal barrier integrity in invivo animal models of intestinal inflammation were assessed up-to August 2020 from the PubMed, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Library databases under the PRISMA methodology. The risk of bias was assessed from ARRAY and SCYRCLE tools.From 1241 articles, 14 studies were included. In animals, oral resveratrol (n=6) improves the intestinal barrier integrity and reduces intestinal damage. Additionally, grape seed extract (n=2), curcumin (n=1), genistein (n=1), chlorogenic acid (n=1), grape pomace (n=1), olive leaf (n=1) or cranberry extract (n=1) improve the intestinal barrier integrity downregulating various inflammatory molecules (TNF-, and other interleukins), and increasing the antioxidant enzymes in animals. Furthermore, resveratrol, quercetin, epigallocatechin, and other PCs improve the epithelial barrier integrity and pro-inflammatory molecule expression in the intestinal epithelia.The oral PC administration in animals improves the intestinal barrier integrity and function from three main mechanisms: 1) The reduction of pro-inflammatory molecules, 2) the improvement in tight-junction protein expression, and 3) the improvement of the antioxidant intracellular activity suggesting the potential use of PCs in the management of intestinal injury in humans, particularly for resveratrol, the most studied PC.</span></div></label></td>\

However, the resistance of cancer cells has dramatically reduced the efficacy of chemotherapy. Cisplatin is a chemotherapeutic agent and its potential in cancer therapy has been restricted by resistance of cancer cells. As a consequence, the scientists have attempted to find new strategies in elevating chemotherapy efficacy. Due to great anti-tumour activity, naturally occurring compounds are of interest in polychemotherapy. Quercetin is a flavonoid with high anti-tumour activity against different cancers that can be used with cisplatin to enhance its efficacy and also are seen to sensitise cancer cells into chemotherapy. Furthermore, cisplatin has side effects such as nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Administration of quercetin is advantageous in reducing the adverse effects of cisplatin without compromising its anti-tumour activity. In this review, we investigate the dual role of quercetin in enhancing anti-tumour activity of cisplatin and simultaneous reduction in its adverse effects.</span></div></label></td>\

Previous treatments existed some limitations of poor bioavailability and targeting the efficiency of drugs. In this study, a novel glycyrrhizin mediated liver-targeted alginate nanogels, which can deliver the antioxidant quercetin to the liver for the treatment of acute liver injury. In vitro radical scavenging results showed that the antioxidant activity of quercetin was increased 81-fold. The tissue distribution results indicated that glycyrrhizin-mediated nanogels showed stronger fluorescence intensity in the liver, which improved liver targeting and therapeutic efficacy. Quercetin-glycyrrhizin nanogels were more effective at restoring liver injury as indicated on serum markers, including alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total bilirubin. The histopathology result showed that quercetin-glycyrrhizin nanogels reversed liver damage. Oxidative parameters of malondialdehyde and glutathione s-transferase were decreased, which provided supporting evidence of antioxidation. Moreover, quercetin-glycyrrhizin nanogels were more effective in down-regulating the inflammation-related gene expression of tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase and monocyte chemotactic protein-1. In conclusion, the novel glycyrrhizin mediated liver-targeted alginate nanogels might be a promising treatment for acute liver failure.</span></div></label></td>\

Bush and Tanzi proposed 2008 in the metal hypothesis of Alzheimers disease that a breakdown in metal homeostasis is the main cause of NDs, and drugs restoring metal homeostasis are promising novel therapeutic strategies. We report here that metallothionein (MT), an endogenous metal detoxifying protein, is increased in young amyloid  (A) expressing Caenorhabditis elegans, whereas it is not in wild type strains. Further MT induction collapsed in 8days old transgenic worms, indicating the age dependency of disease outbreak, and sharing intriguing parallels to diminished MT levels in human brains of AD.

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Cadmium (Cd), a highly toxic heavy metal, adversely affects human and animal health. Quercetin (Que) is a kind of flavonoid that can protect many tissues from the toxic effect of heavy metals. Although many studies have explored the adverse effects of cadmium on rats and other animals, the mechanism of Cd-induced testicular autophagy and the antagonistic effect of Que on cadmium remain unclear. In this study, Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with Cd, Que or Cd, and Que supplements to explore the mechanisms of Que-alleviated testis injury caused by Cd exposure. The rat body weight and relative testicular weight were measured. Morphological changes in testes and indices of oxidative stress were also examined. The expression levels of autophagy-related genes were detected as well. Results showed that Cd decreased the rat body weight and relative testicular weight and induced pathological changes in testes. Conversely, Que alleviated these changes. We also found that Cd increased the malondialdehyde content and decreased the contents of total superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and glutathione. Moreover, the protein expression levels of P62 and LC3-II increased under Cd exposure conditions. Conversely, Que obviously alleviated these toxic activities induced by Cd. Overall, this study showed that Cd accumulated in rat testes, leading to oxidative stress and autophagy. Que can reduce cadmium toxicity by reducing oxidative stress and inhibiting autophagy. The specific mechanism of Que antagonizing Cd toxicity can provide new insights into countering cadmium toxicity.</span></div></label></td>\

Quercetin (QCT), a natural flavonoid which is commonly found in numerous fruits and vegetables, has extensive pharmacological effects, such as anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-senescence effects.This study aims to explain whether ferroptosis is a therapeutic strategy to AKI, and to explore the effect of QCT on AKI ferroptosis.NRK-52E cells and HK-2 cells were used for in vitro ferroptosis studies. Morphology of cells was detected by transmission electron microscopy. Lipid ROS was assayed using flow cytometry. In vivo, AKI was induced by ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) or folic acid (FA). To explore the molecular mechanisms, RNA-sequence analysis was performed. Transwell was used to detect macrophage migration.We discovered that quercetin (QCT), a natural flavonoid, inhibited ferroptosis in renal proximal tubular epithelial cells. QCT blocked the typical morphologic changes of ferroptotic cells by reducing the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and lipid ROS and increasing the levels of glutathione (GSH). Moreover, QCT ameliorated AKI induced by I/R or FA. RNA-sequence analysis highlighted activation transcription factor 3 (ATF3), as it was the dominant one among all the 299 down-regulated genes by QCT. Knockdown of ATF3 could significantly increase the levels of SLC7A11, GPX4 and increased the cell viability. In addition, ferroptotic cells were found to be extremely pro-inflammatory by recruiting macrophages through CCL2, while QCT inhibited the chemotaxis of macrophages induced by ferroptosis in AKI.Collectively, these results identify QCT as a ferroptosis inhibitor and provide new therapeutic strategies for diseases related to ferroptosis.</span></div></label></td>\

Tritrichomonas foetus strains cause the disease trichomoniasis in farm animals (cattle, bulls, pigs) and diarrhea in domestic animals (cats and dogs). Because some T. vaginalis strains have become resistant to the widely used drug metronidazole, there is a need to develop alternative treatments, based on safe natural products that have the potential to replace and/or enhance the activity of lower doses of metronidazole. To help meet this need, this overview collates and interprets worldwide reported studies on the efficacy of structurally different classes of food, marine, and medicinal plant extracts and some of their bioactive pure compounds against T. vaginalis and T. foetus in vitro and in infected mice and women. Active food extracts include potato peels and their glycoalkaloids -chaconine and -solanine, caffeic and chlorogenic acids, and quercetin; the tomato glycoalkaloid -tomatine; theaflavin-rich black tea extracts and bioactive theaflavins; plant essential oils and their compounds (+)--bisabolol and eugenol; the grape skin compound resveratrol; the kidney bean lectin, marine extracts from algae, seaweeds, and fungi and compounds that are derived from fungi; medicinal extracts and about 30 isolated pure compounds. Also covered are the inactivation of drug-resistant T. vaginalis and T. foetus strains by sensitized light; anti-trichomonad effects in mice and women; beneficial effects of probiotics in women; and mechanisms that govern cell death. The summarized findings will hopefully stimulate additional research, including molecular-mechanism-guided inactivations and human clinical studies, that will help ameliorate adverse effects of pathogenic protozoa.</span></div></label></td>\

Diabetes and obesity can lead to the accumulation of amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and other symptoms of AD through several pathways, including insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, adipokines dysregulation, and vascular impairment. Currently, the use of polyphenols has been expanded in animal models and in-vitro studies because of their comparatively negligible adverse effects. Among them, quercetin (QT) is one of the most abundant polyphenolic flavonoids, which is present in fruits and vegetables and displays many biological, health-promoting effects in a wide range of diseases. The low bioavailability and poor solubility of QT have also led researchers to make various QT-involved nanoparticles (NPs) to overcome these limitations. In this paper, we review significant molecular mechanisms induced by diabetes and obesity that increase AD pathogenesis. Then, we summarize in vitro, in vivo, and clinical evidence regarding the anti-Alzheimer, anti-diabetic and anti-obesity effects of QT. Finally, QT in pure and combination form using NPs has been suggested as a promising therapeutic agent for future studies.</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Flavonols play key roles in many plant defense mechanisms, consequently they are frequently investigated as stress sensitive factors in relation to several oxidative processes. It is well known that grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) can synthesize various flavonol glycosides in the leaves, however, very little information is available regarding their distribution along the cane at different leaf levels. In this work, taking into consideration of leaf position, the main flavonol glycosides of a red grapevine cultivar (Cabernet Sauvignon) were profiled and quantified by HPLC-DAD analysis. It was found that amount of four flavonol glycosides, namely, quercetin-3-O-galactoside, quercetin-3-O-glucoside, kaempferol-3-O-glucoside and kaempferol-3-O-glucuronide decreased towards the shoot tip. Since leaf age also decreases towards the shoot tip, the obtained results suggest that these compounds continuously formed by leaf aging, resulting in their accumulation in the older leaves. In contrast, quercetin-3-O-glucuronide (predominant form) and quercetin-3-O-rutinoside were not accumulated significantly by aging. We also pointed out that grapevine boosted the flavonol biosynthesis in September, and flavonol profile differed significantly in the two seasons. Our results contribute to the better understanding of the role of flavonols in the antioxidant defense system of grapevine.</span></div></label></td>\

In the present study, we examined the toxic effects of lead acetate (Pb) on testicular structure and the possible effect of quercetin on mitigating these effects. The apoptotic changes in the testes were also studied by the TUNEL assay and changes in apoptosis-related gene (Bax, Bcl-2, and caspase-3) expression. Twenty-one male mice were randomly divided into 3 groups of control, Pb, and lead acetate + quercetin. Testicular weight, both absolute and relative, was higher in Pb-exposed mice in comparison with the control and Pb-quercetin groups. The increase in size of testis was related to the lumen and connective tissue in this group. Lead acetate induced different patterns in testicular cell number; as spermatogonia, spermatocyte, and Sertoli cells number did not affect in lead acetate exposed group, while total number of round spermatids and long spermatids significantly reduced.In addition, Bcl-2 expression was downregulated, and Bax expression was upregulated in Pb-treated group in comparison with the control and Pb + quercetin groups. The TUNEL assay revealed that the number of apoptotic cells in Pb-treated group were increaed significantley in comparison to other groups. In conclusion, Pb administration adversely impacted on the cellular organization and activation of the apoptotic pathways in the testis; on the other hand, quercetin co-administration with lead partially ameliorated these adverse effects.</span></div></label></td>\

This study was mainly aimed at investigating the effects of A. cepa extract (ACE) enriched in polyphenols on hyperlipidemia Sprague-Dawley (SD) experiment rat models. The levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in serum and liver were measured using ELISA kits. In addition, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) technique was used to observe the liver and the aortic arch pathology. Moreover, western blotting (WB) method was applied to analyze LDL receptor (LDLR) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase (HMGCR) in liver. As a result, quercetin (2.42mg/g DW) and isoquercitrin (4.60mg/g DW) were the main constituents of ACE using HPLC analysis. Furthermore, ACE reduced the levels of TC, TG, LDL-C, and MDA, and increased HDL levels and elevated SOD activity both in serum and liver in hyperlipidemic SD rats (p<.05). HE results showed that liver fat drops of the rats in ACE group were obviously decreased, and the lipid and foam cells of the aortic arch of the rats in ACE group were markedly ameliorated. WB results showed that ACE promoted the degradation of HMGCR and increased LDLR expression in liver (p<.05). In conclusion, ACE alleviated hyperlipidemia with downregulation of HMGCR and upregulation of LDLR. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Atherosclerosis, a major cardiovascular disease, is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the developed countries. Moreover, accumulating data indicate that, during atherosclerosis development, hyperlipidemia is an important risk factor. To date, hyperlipidemia is mainly treated with hyperlipidemic agents including statins, in spite of the side effects and poor tolerance in some patients. In addition, Allium cepa is a medicinal and edible plant. Furthermore, A. cepa is used for the prevention and treatment of hyperlipidemia-related diseases such as atherosclerosis in the folk. But the underlying mechanism is still unclear. In fact, this research showed that A. cepa extract (ACE) alleviated hyperlipidemia with downregulation of HMGCR and upregulation of LDLR, suggesting that ACE might be a potential option for hyperlipidemia as non-statin lipid-lowering agent.</span></div></label></td>\

Simvastatin serves as a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) inhibitor, with prolonged use proven to cause side effects. In the present study, antihyperlipidemic material is tested for its effect in lowering lipid in animals and its proven ability to bind to HMGR. Hyperlipidemia rats were divided into four groups, with different doses of 0, 57, and 114 mg/kg BW of apple peel extract (APE) and simvastatin (3.6 mg/kg BW). The total cholesterol (TC), total triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) serum were measured. In silico inhibition test of HMGR activity was conducted by molecular docking using PyRx software. This process places HMGR as a receptor and active compound of apple peels as a ligand. APE treatment with a dose of 114 mg/kg BW could significantly reduce LDLc and increase serum HDLc levels. Docking tests confirmed that quercetin, chlorogenic acid, epicatechin, and catechins depicted HMGR inhibition. Quercetin could bind to HMGR at a similar location to amino acid residues as simvastatin. These material extracts have inhibited cholesterol synthesis through a stronger HMGR inhibition than simvastatin.</span></div></label></td>\

The present study aimed to identify the active chemical constituents of this traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and investigate their mechanisms through interleukin-6 (IL-6) integrating network pharmacological approaches.We collected the compounds from all herbal ingredients of the previously mentioned TCM, but those that could down-regulate IL-6 were screened through the network pharmacology approach. Then, we modeled molecular docking to evaluate the binding affinity between compounds and IL-6. Furthermore, we analyzed the biological processes and pathways of compounds. Finally, we screened out the core genes of compounds through the construction of the protein-protein interaction network and the excavation of gene clusters of compounds.The network pharmacology research showed that TCM could decrease IL-6 using several compounds, such as quercetin, ursolic acid, luteolin, and rutin. Molecular docking results showed that the molecular binding affinity with IL-6 of all compounds except -aminobutyric acid was < -5.0 kJ/mol, indicating the potential of numerous active compounds in TCM to directly interact with IL-6, leading to an anti-inflammation effect. Finally, Cytoscape 3.7.2 was used to topologize the biological processes and pathways of compounds, revealing potential mechanisms for COVID-19 treatment.These results indicated the positive effect of TCM on the prevention and rehabilitation of COVID-19 in at-risk people.

A reduction rate of 23.7-63.8% in simulated solution was founded. Kinetic studies indicated that ornithine was a byproduct of alcoholysis reaction when EC formed, while quercetin could compete with the precursor ethanol and react with carbamyl compounds, which therefore preventedEC accumulation. A maximum of 47.2% decrease of EC in soy sauce was achieved, and no remarkable changes in volatile compounds profile and color of soy sauce were found.

Epigenetic changes are owned by various environmental factors including pollution, microbiota and diet, which have profound effects on epigenetic modifiers. The bioactive compounds present in the diet mainly include curcumin, resveratrol, catechins, quercetin, genistein, sulforaphane, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, alkaloids, vitamins, and peptides. Bioactive compounds released during fermentation by the action of microbes also have a significant effect on the host epigenome. Besides, recent studies have explored the new insights in vitamins functions through epigenetic regulation. These bioactive compounds exert synergistic, preventive and therapeutic effects when combined as well as when used with chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, these compounds have potential of therapeutic agents that could be used as "Epidrug" to treat many inflammatory diseases and various cancers where chemotherapy results have many side effects.

Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence internal (CI).Higher concentrations of serum flavonols, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, flavanones and naringenin were significantly associated with lower breast cancer risk, with adjusted ORs (95% CIs) for the highest versus the lowest group of 0.66 (0.49-0.89) for flavonols, 0.52 (0.38-0.70) for isorhamnetin, 0.60 (0.45-0.80) for kaempferol, 0.65 (0.49-0.87) for flavanones and 0.45 (0.34-0.60) for naringenin, respectively. Significant positive associations were observed between serum flavan-3-ols, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate and breast cancer risk. No significant associations were observed for serum quercetin, flavones, apigenin, luteolin, hesperetin, catechin, epicatechin and epicatechin-3-gallate with overall breast cancer risk.This study suggested that serum flavonols and flavanones were inversely associated with breast cancer risk and serum flavan-3-ols were positively associated with breast cancer risk. Serum flavones were not associated with overall breast cancer risk. These findings warrant further confirmation in prospective studies.</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Infection is a common complication in the process of wound management. An ideal wound dressing is supposed to reduce or even prevent the infection while promoting wound healing. A porcine acellular dermal matrix (pADM) has been already used as a wound dressing in clinic due to its capacity to accelerate wound healing. However, not only is pure pADM not antibacterial, its mechanical properties are poor. In this study, an antibacterial pADM with good performance was prepared by adding two natural products as modifiers, quercetin (QCT) and tea tree oil (TTO). The result of Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) proved that the addition of modifiers did not break the natural triple-helical structure of collagen. Meanwhile, the results of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TG), mechanic experiment, and enzymatic degradation demonstrated that pADM handled with QCT and TTO (termed QCT-TTO-pADM) had better thermal stability, mechanical strength, and resistance to enzymatic degradation than pADM. Meanwhile, QCT-TTO-pADM had excellent antibacterial activity and showed an antibacterial rate of over 80%. Furthermore, in the cytocompatibility analysis, QCT-TTO-pADM had no side effects on the adhesion, growth, and proliferation of fibroblasts. QCT-TTO-pADM could even accelerate wound healing more efficiently than pADM and glutaraldehyde-modified pADM (GA-pADM). In conclusion, QCT-TTO-pADM was a potential antibacterial wound dressing with good performance.</span></div></label></td>\

AhR is also modulated by various endogenous ligands e.g. highly potent tryptophan (Trp)-derivative FICZ (6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole) and natural ligands abundant in the human diet e.g. polyphenols. Therefore, evaluating AhR species-specific responses is crucial for understanding AhR physiological functions, establishing risk assessments, and exploring the applicability of AhR mediators in drug and food industry towards human-based usages. We studied AhR transactivation of FICZ/TCDD invitro in a time-dependent and species-specific manner using dioxin responsive luciferase reporter gene assays derived from rat (DR-H4IIE) and human (DR-HepG2) hepatoma cells. We observed for the first time that FICZ potency was similar in both cell lines and was 40 times higher than TCDD in DR-HepG2 cells. Depleting Trp-derivative endogenously produced ligands by using culture medium without Trp, resulted in 3-fold higher AhR activation upon adding FICZ in DR-H4IIE cells, in contrast to DR-HepG2 cells which revealed a fast degradation of FICZ induction from 10h post-exposure to complete disappearance after 24h. Seven polyphenols and a mixture thereof, chosen based on commercially recommended doses and adjusted to human realistic exposure, caused rat and human species-specific AhR responses. Two isoflavones (daidzein and genistein) induced rat AhR synergistic effects with FICZ and/or TCDD, while quercetin, chrysin, curcumin, resveratrol, and the mixture exerted a strong inhibitory effect on the human AhR. Strikingly, resveratrol and quercetin at their realistic nanomolar concentrations acted additively in the mixture to abolish human AhR activation induced by various TCDD concentrations. Taken together, these results illustrate the species-specific complexity of AhR transcriptional activities modulated by various ligands and highlight the need for studies of human-based approaches.</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">For the past decade, migratory beekeepers who provide honey bees for pollination services have experienced substantial colony losses on a recurring basis that have been attributed in part to exposure to insecticides, fungicides, or their combinations applied to crops. The phytochemicals p-coumaric acid and quercetin, which occur naturally in a wide variety of bee foods, including beebread and many types of honey, can enhance adult bee longevity and reduce the toxicity of certain pesticides. How variation in concentrations of natural dietary constituents affects interactions with xenobiotics, including synthetic pesticides, encountered in agroecosystems remains an open question. We tested the effects of these two phytochemicals at a range of natural concentrations on impacts of consuming propiconazole and chlorantraniliprole, a triazole fungicide and an insecticide frequently applied as a tank mix to almond trees during bloom in Californias Central Valley. Propiconazole, even at low field concentrations, significantly reduced survival and longevity when consumed by adult bees in a sugar-based diet. The effects of propiconazole in combination with chlorantraniliprole enhanced mortality risk. The detrimental effects of the two pesticides were for the most part reduced when either or both of the phytochemicals were present in the diet. These findings suggest that honey bees may depend on non-nutritive but physiologically active phytochemical components of their natural foods for ameliorating xenobiotic stress, although only over a certain range of concentrations; particularly at the high end of the natural range, certain combinations can incur additive toxicity. Thus, efforts to develop nectar or pollen substitutes with phytochemicals to boost insecticide tolerance or immunity or to evaluate toxicity of pesticides to pollinators should take concentration-dependent effects of phytochemicals into consideration.</span></div></label></td>\

This may partly be due to the risk of increased incidences of heat stress associated with raising livestock in warmer ambient temperatures, facilitated by global warming, reducing antioxidant capacity. The current research demonstrates the effect of dietary DHQ, vitaminEand standard or high ambient temperatures on growth performance, energy and nutrient metabolism, gastrointestinal tract (GIT)development, jejunal villus morphometry and antioxidant status in broiler chickens. Each of the four experimental diets was fed to 16 pens of five birds, which were allocated to four rooms (four pens in each room). The temperature in two rooms was maintained at aconstant 35C (high temperature; HT), and the temperature in the other two rooms was gradually reduced from 27C at 7 dof age to 22C at 20 dof age (standard temperature; ST). Rearing birds at HT reduced feed intake, weight gain, weight of small intestine, total GIT, liver, spleen, heart, villus height, villus surface area and lowered blood glutationperoxidase (GSH-Px). Dietary DHQ increased blood GSH-Px and total antioxidant status, increased heart weight and reduced caecal size. When fed separately, DHQ and vitamin E improved hepatic vitamin E concentration. Feeding vitamin Eincreased spleen and liver weights. When fed together, DHQ and vitamin Ereduced villus height, villus height to crypt depth ratio and villus surface area. Temperature and antioxidants did not affect energy and nutrient metabolism. There were no effects of dietary antioxidants on growth performance of broiler chickens and there were no mortalities. At present, it is unclear if feeding antioxidants (in particular DHQ) at different levels, using different dietary formulations, and rearing birds under arange of environmental conditions may be effective at enhancing production performance and bird health in hot ambient climates.</span></div></label></td>\

The children were divided into three groups: conventional chemotherapy group, imatinib group and dasatinib group. Height was expressed as standard deviation score(HtSDS). In the three groups, we compared the HtSDS and HtSDS at the start of treatment and during follow-up period and also compared the adult height and median parental height(MPH). We further compared the HtSDS classified by age and gender in imatinib group. At last, univariate analysis was used to analyze the influencing factors on the deceleration of height growth by imatinib.There were 298 children in conventional chemotherapy group, 39 in imatinib group and 7 in dasatinib group. In imatinib group, the mean HtSDS of children at follow-up time was significantly lower than that at the start of treatment (P < 0.05), regardless of age and gender. In imatinib group, the decrease of HtSDS in girls was more obvious than in boys(P = 0.031). The HtSDS gradually decreased in the first and the second year in imatinib group. After discontinuation of imatinib, the HtSDS had no obvious change. Multivariate analysis showed that the HtSDS at the start of imatinib was negatively correlated with severe growth impairment on imatinib therapy. The HtSDS in dasatinib group and conventional chemotherapy group maintained a high degree of consistency.Imatinib can affect growth velocity in children with ALL, regardless of age and gender. With the discontinuation of imatinib, the inhibitory effect will not continue. The lower HtSDS at the start of imatinib therapy, the more obvious effect of imatinib on growth impairment will be, and the effect will be more obvious in girls than boys.</span></div></label></td>\

Lonidamine is frequently used in cancer treatment, but its often preferred to be used in combination with other drugs because of its side effects. In the present study, the efficacy of the combination of lonidamine with quercetin, a flavonoid of natural origin, on human MCF-7 breast cancer cells was evaluated. The results showed that the combined use of the compounds significantly increased cytotoxicity compared to administration alone (p<0.0001). In addition, while lonidamine induced a cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, administration of quercetin and its combination with lonidamine arrested the cell division at S point, indicating the synergistic strength of quercetin on cytotoxicity. The combination of quercetin and lonidamine significantly induced apoptosis of MCF-7 cells (p<0.0001) and increased caspase levels (p<0.0001). In this study, the combination of quercetin and lonidamine has been evaluated for the first time and the combination treatment decreased MMP-2/-9 mRNA expression more potently than the effects of the compounds alone. The results showed that lonidamine was more effective when combined with quercetin, and their combination may be a candidate for a novel strategy of treatment for breast cancer.</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a class of cancer cells characterized by self-renewal, differentiation and tumorigenic potential. We previously established a model of CSCs by culturing mouse induced pluripotent stem cells (miPSCs) for four weeks in the presence of a conditioned medium (CM) of cancer cell lines, which functioned as the tumor microenvironment. Based on this methodology of developing CSCs from miPSCs, we assessed the risk of 110 non-mutagenic chemical compounds, most of which are known as inhibitors of cytoplasmic signaling pathways, as potential carcinogens. We treated miPSCs with each compound for one week in the presence of a CM of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells. However, one-week period was too short for the CM to convert miPSCs into CSCs. Consequently, PDO325901 (MEK inhibitor), CHIR99021 (GSK-3 inhibitor) and Dasatinib (Abl, Src and c-Kit inhibitor) were found to confer miPSCs with the CSC phenotype in one week. The tumor cells that survived exhibited stemness markers, spheroid formation and tumorigenesis in Balb/c nude mice. Hence, we concluded that the three signal inhibitors accelerated the conversion of miPSCs into CSCs. Similarly to our previous study, we found that the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway was upregulated in the CSCs. Herein, we focused on the expression of relative genes after the treatment with these three inhibitors. Our results demonstrated an increased expression of pik3ca, pik3cb, pik3r5 and pik3r1 genes indicating class IA PI3K as the responsible signaling pathway. Hence, AKT phosphorylation was found to be up-regulated in the obtained CSCs. Inhibition of Erk1/2, tyrosine kinase, and/or GSK-3 was implied to be involved in the enhancement of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in the undifferentiated cells, resulting in the sustained stemness, and subsequent conversion of miPSCs into CSCs in the tumor microenvironment.</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Alzheimers disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative brain disorder characterizedby memory impairment, dementia, and oxidative stress in elderly people. Currently, onlya few drugs are available in the market with various adverse effects. Therefore, to developnew drugs with protective action against the disease, research is turning to the identification ofplant products as a remedy. Natural compounds with anti-inflammatory activity could be goodcandidates for developing effective therapeutic strategies. Phytochemicals, including Curcumin,Resveratrol, Quercetin, Huperzine-A, Rosmarinic acid, genistein, obovatol, and Oxyresvertarol,were reported molecules for the treatment of AD. Several alkaloids, such as galantamine,oridonin, glaucocalyxin B, tetrandrine, berberine and anatabine, have been shownanti-inflammatory effects in AD models in vitro as well as in-vivo. In conclusion, naturalproducts from plants represent interesting candidates for the treatment of AD. This reviewhighlights the potential of specific compounds from natural products along with their syntheticderivatives to counteract AD in the CNS.</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Long-term poor glycemic control negatively affects macrovascular and microvascular diseases, as well as wound restoration. Buckwheat is a good source of rutin (quercetin-3-O-rutoside) and has benefits in regulating blood sugar. This study was to evaluate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of rutin on wound healing in streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemic rats. Eighteen male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups: normal (NDM), hyperglycemic (DM), and hyperglycemic with rutin (DMR). After induction of hyperglycemia for 2 days, a 15  15 mm wound was induced on the back of each rat. Intraperitoneal injection of rutin significantly ameliorated diabetes-induced body weight loss and improved metabolic dysfunctions of hyperglycemic rats. Based on appearance and histopathological staining, rutin promotes wound healing and inhibits production of inflammatory cells. The immunoblotting data indicated that rutin promotes production of antioxidant enzymes induced by nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), inhibits the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) regulated by NF-B, and decreases the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). It also promotes the expression of neurogenic-related protein (UCH-L1). The aforementioned results indicated that rutin reduces oxidative stress and inflammatory response in hyperglycemic rats, promoting wound healing and subsequently reducing the risk of wound ulcers.</span></div></label></td>\

To prevent the cells against side effects of CP and its metabolites, increasing antioxidant defence mechanism of the body with supplemental antioxidants is important. Therefore, there is a requirement for effective agents which could prevent the healthy cells from the harmful effects of drug-induced toxicities. Several antioxidants have been used in protecting or alleviating CP-induced cell death. However, no such study is reported in CP-induced SH-SY5Y cell toxicity. The aim of this study was to evaluate likelihood ameliorative effects of caffeic acid, chrysin, quercetin and ferulic acid against CP-induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y neuron cells.In this study protective effects of quercetin, chrysin, caffeic acid and ferulic acid against CP-induced cell toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells was evaluated by cell proliferation assay, lipid peroxidation (LPO) analysis to decipher antioxidant capacity, tunel assay and qRT-PCR experiments to examine anti-apoptotic activities of the antioxidants. The results showed that CP-induced cell toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells and treatments with the antioxidants suppressed the cell death. Our results suggests that these anti-oxidants protected SH-SY5Y cells via a decrease in LPO levels, downregulating the expression of Cas-3, Cyt c and Bax and upregulating expression of anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2.The use of antioxidant as nutritional supplements, and in particular of caffeic acid, chrysin, quercetin and ferulic acid, reduce apoptotic effects of CP in SH-SY5Y cells that could add insight into therapeutic approaches to CP-induced cell injuries.</span></div></label></td>\

SOD inhibition with ATM also increases mitochondrial Fe(II).

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Despite recent advances in clinical stem cell therapy applications based on human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), potential teratoma formation due to the presence of residual undifferentiated hPSCs remains a serious risk factor that challenges widespread clinical application. To overcome this risk, a variety of approaches have been developed to eliminate the remaining undifferentiated hPSCs via selective cell death induction. Our study seeks to identify natural flavonoids that are more potent than quercetin (QC), to selectively induce hPSC death. Upon screening in-house flavonoids, luteolin (LUT) is found to be more potent than QC to eliminate hPSCs in a p53-dependent manner, but not hPSC-derived smooth muscle cells or perivascular progenitor cells. Particularly, treating human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived cardiomyocytes with LUT efficiently eliminates the residual hESCs and only results in marginal effects on cardiomyocyte (CM) functions, as determined by calcium influx. Considering the technical limitations of isolating CMs due to a lack of exclusive surface markers at the end of differentiation, LUT treatment is a promising approach to minimize teratoma formation risk.</span></div></label></td>\

However, there is a lack of effective biomarkers and drugs for AD diagnosis and therapeutics so far. In this study, bioinformatics analysis combined with an experimental verification strategy was used to identify the biomarkers and the quercetin targets for AD diagnosis and treatment. First, differentially expressed genes in the AD brain were identified by microarray data analysis. Second, quercetin, a predominant flavonoid, was used to screen the target genes. Third, the drug-disease network was determined, and the target genes of quercetin treatment were obtained in AD-related HT-22 cell-based assay. Six genes, including MAPT, PIK3R1, CASP8, DAPK1, MAPK1, and CYCS, were validated by the system pharmacology analysis in the hippocampus samples of AD patients. The results suggested that MAPT, PIK3R1, CASP8, and DAPK1 were significantly increased, but MAPK1 and CYCS were significantly decreased in HT-22 cells after A1-42 treatment. Moreover, MAPK1 and CYCS were markedly increased, but MAPT, PIK3R1, CASP8, and DAPK1 were markedly decreased after quercetin treatment in these HT-22 cells. Altogether, MAPT, PIK3R1, CASP8, DAPK1, MAPK1, and CYCS are all the biomarkers for AD diagnosis and the targets of quercetin treatment, and our findings may provide valuable biomarkers for AD diagnosis and treatment.</span></div></label></td>\
