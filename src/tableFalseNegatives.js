Because a number of biological properties of quercetin may be beneficial to human health, interest in the addition of this flavonol to various traditional food products has been increasing. Prior to the use of quercetin in food applications that would increase intake beyond that from naturally-occurring levels of the flavonol in the typical Western diet, its safety needs to be established or confirmed. This review provides a critical examination of the scientific literature associated with the safety of quercetin. Results of numerous genotoxicity and mutagenicity, short- and long-term animal, and human studies are reviewed in the context of quercetin exposure in vivo. To reconcile results of in vitro studies, which consistently demonstrated quercetin-related mutagenicity to the absence of carcinogenicity in vivo, the mechanisms that lead to the apparent in vitro mutagenicity, and those that ensure absence of quercetin toxicity in vivo are discussed. The weight of the available evidence supports the safety of quercetin for addition to food.</span></div></label></td>\

The main goal of aging research is to find therapies that attenuate aging and alleviate aging-related diseases. In this study, we screened a natural product library for geroprotective compounds using Werner syndrome (WS) human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), a premature aging model that we recently established. Ten candidate compounds were identified and quercetin was investigated in detail due to its leading effects. Mechanistic studies revealed that quercetin alleviated senescence via the enhancement of cell proliferation and restoration of heterochromatin architecture in WS hMSCs. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed the transcriptional commonalities and differences in the geroprotective effects by quercetin and Vitamin C. Besides WS hMSCs, quercetin also attenuated cellular senescence in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) and physiological-aging hMSCs. Taken together, our study identifies quercetin as a geroprotective agent against accelerated and natural aging in hMSCs, providing a potential therapeutic intervention for treating age-associated disorders.</span></div></label></td>\

We realised a literature review to identify 21 protein kinases (PKs) that were possibly involved in CF caused by PKIs. Pearson correlation coefficients (r) between aRORs and affinity data of the 15 PKIs for the 21 PKs were calculated to identify the cellular target most likely to be involved in PKI-induced CF.A total of 141601 individual case safety reports (ICSRs) were extracted from VigiBase for the following PKIs: afatinib, axitinib, bosutinib, crizotinib, dasatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, imatinib, lapatinib, nilotinib, pazopanib, ruxolitinib, sorafenib, sunitinib and vandetanib. Among them, 2594 ICSRs concerned CF. The disproportionality analysis revealed that, for dasatinib, imatinib, bosutinib, sunitinib and nilotinib, disproportionality for CF was significantly higher than for other PKIs, with aRORs of 2.52 [95% CI 2.26, 2.82], 1.79 (95% CI 1.57, 2.03), 1.73 (95% CI 1.18, 2.54), 1.67 (95% CI 1.51, 1.84) and 1.38 (95% CI 1.18, 1.61), respectively. Significant values for correlation coefficients between the product of dissociation constant (pKd) and aROR were observed for two non-receptor protein kinases: ABL1 (non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms) and ABL2 protein kinases, with values of r = 0.83 (P = 0.0001), r = 0.75 (P = 0.0014) and r = 0.78 (P = 0.0006), respectively.We observed a higher disproportionality for CF with dasatinib, imatinib, bosutinib, sunitinib and nilotinib than with other PKIs.

A phase 1 dose escalation study was performed to evaluate the safety of quercetin in 30 untreated patients with chronic HCV infection and to preliminarily characterize quercetin potential in suppressing viral load and/or liver injury. Quercetin displayed safety in all trial participants. Additionally, 8 patients showed a clinically meaningful 0.41-log viral load decrease. There was a positive correlation (r = 0.41, p = 0.03) indicating a tendency for HCV decrease in patients with a lower ratio of plasma quercetin relative to dose. No significant changes in aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase were detected.

Although they share the same mechanism of action, namely competitive ATP inhibition at the catalytic binding site of tyrosine kinase, they differ from each other in the spectrum of targeted kinases, their pharmacokinetics as well as substance-specific adverse effects. With variations from drug to drug, tyrosine kinase inhibitors cause skin toxicity, including folliculitis, in more than 50% of patients. Among the tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are commercially available as yet, the agents that target EGFR, erlotinib and gefitinib, display the broadest spectrum of adverse effects on skin and hair, including folliculitis, paronychia, facial hair growth, facial erythema, and varying forms of frontal alopecia. In contrast, folliculitis is not common during administration of sorafenib and sunitinib, which target VEGFR, PDGFR, FLT3, and others, whereas both agents have been associated with subungual splinter hemorrhages. Periorbital edema is a common adverse effect of imatinib. Besides the haematological side effects of most of TKIs like anemia, thrombopenia and neutropenia, the most common extra-heamatologic adverse effects are edema, nausea, hypothyroidism, vomiting and diarrhea. Regarding possible long term effects, recently cardiac toxicity with congestive heart failure is under debate in patients receiving imatinib and sunitinib therapy; however, this observation was probably relate to patients selection, although, TKIs overall appear to be a very well tolerated drug class.</span></div></label></td>\

The stability of quercetin in different matrices at various temperatures and pH, and the quercetin content of six capsules of the herbal preparation Quercetin-500 Plus were determined by HPLC. Subjects received quercetin 500 mg three times daily and blood and urine samples were obtained. The concentration of quercetin aglycone and conjugated metabolites were assayed using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using noncompartmental analysis with WinNonlin. A population compartment model incorporating input from the gallbladder was developed to account for the enterohepatic recirculation observed with quercetin. The oral clearance (CL/F) was high (3.5 x 10(4)l/h) with an average terminal half-life of 3.5 h for quercetin. The plasma concentration versus time curves exhibited re-entry peaks. A one-compartment model that included enterohepatic recirculation best described the plasma data. This represents the first comprehensive evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and enterohepatic recirculation of quercetin in humans. Population pharmacokinetic models adapted for enterohepatic recirculation allowed an assessment of the magnitude and frequency of the enterohepatic recirculation process.</span></div></label></td>\

We evaluated the effects of different doses of resveratrol and quercetin and their combination therapy on aging marker in human kidney cell culture under hyperglycemia condition.Human embryonic kidney cell (HEK-293) was cultured in Dulbeccos Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 100 mM (18 mg/L) for 24 h. The cells were treated with resveratrol (2.5, 5, 10 m), quercetin (3, 6, 12 m), and combination of these (R 2.5 m, Q 3 m) and (R 5 m, Q 6 m) and (R 10 m, Q 12 m) for 48 h, and then, cells were lysed to access RNA and lysate.The analysis of data showed that beta-galactosidase enzyme gene expression as an aging marker in all treatment groups has reduced in a dose-dependent manner. Gene expression of Sirtuin1 and thioredoxin (Trx) in all treated groups in comparison to control group increased in a dose-dependent fashion. Trx interacting protein (TXNIP) gene expression decreased in a dose-dependent manner in all treated groups, especially in resveratrol and combination therapy.According to the results of this research, quercetin, resveratrol, and especially combination treatments with increased expression levels of antioxidants, can reduce aging markers in HEK cell line in hyperglycemia conditions. These results lead us to use flavonoids such as resveratrol for anti-aging potential.</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Imatinib, the first-in-class BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), had been a revolution for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and had greatly enhanced patient survival. Second- (dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib) and third-generation (ponatinib) TKIs have been developed to be effective against BCR-ABL mutations making imatinib less effective. However, these treatments have been associated with arterial occlusive events. This review gathers clinical data and experiments about the pathophysiology of these arterial occlusive events with BCR-ABL TKIs. Imatinib is associated with very low rates of thrombosis, suggesting a potentially protecting cardiovascular effect of this treatment in patients with BCR-ABL CML. This protective effect might be mediated by decreased platelet secretion and activation, decreased leukocyte recruitment, and anti-inflammatory or antifibrotic effects. Clinical data have guided mechanistic studies toward alteration of platelet functions and atherosclerosis development, which might be secondary to metabolism impairment. Dasatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib affect endothelial cells and might induce atherogenesis through increased vascular permeability. Nilotinib also impairs platelet functions and induces hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia that might contribute to atherosclerosis development. Description of the pathophysiology of arterial thrombotic events is necessary to implement risk minimization strategies.</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm, the incidence of which increases with age. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the mainstay of CML treatment, including imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib. Beyond matching patient disease profiles with TKI specificity, differences in the efficacy and toxicity profiles and a patients comorbid risk factors should be considered when selecting the most appropriate agent. Our objectives are to review the incidence and severity of cardiovascular, metabolic, and pulmonary disorders associated with these TKIs, highlighting differences in adverse event profiles, suggested risk-mitigation strategies, and guidance for TKI selection in different settings. Patients receiving TKI agents for CML should be monitored for signs and symptoms of toxicity throughout therapy. Preemptive assessment, early toxicity recognition, and prompt management of cardiovascular, metabolic, and pulmonary toxicities can minimize treatment-limiting complications and improve outcomes in patients with CML.</span></div></label></td>\

However, the application of QC in pharmaceutical field is limited due to its poor solubility, low bioavailability, poor permeability and instability. To improve the bioavailability of QC, numerous approaches have been undertaken, involving the use of promising drug delivery systems such as inclusion complexes, liposomes, nanoparticles or micelles, which appear to provide higher solubility and bioavailability. Enhanced bioavailability of QC in the near future is likely to bring this product to the forefront of therapeutic agents for treatment of human disease.</span></div></label></td>\

     <td><label><input type="checkbox"/><div class="wide"><span class="hidden">The bioflavonoid quercetin is a dietary anticancer chemical that is capable of inducing apoptosis in tumor cells. Although the activity of quercetin is believed to be due to its antioxidative properties, it has recently been suggested that quercetin also has prooxidant activities, which might effect cytotoxicity directly. In this study, we used mouse thymocytes to investigate whether quercetin behaved as a protector against oxidative stress or as a cytotoxic agent. Quercetin treatment did not induce oxidative damage, but protected mouse thymocytes from glucose oxidase (GO)-mediated apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that quercetin (50 microM) treatment suppressed the GO-mediated DNA binding activity of redox state-sensitive transcription factors, such as NF-kappaB, AP-1, and p53. This result suggests that quercetin has antioxidative effects on thymocytes. More interestingly, quercetin treatment alone (50 microM) increased the DNA-binding activity of AP-1, which consisted of heterodimer of c-Jun and Fra-2. Finally, the antioxidant activity of quercetin was confirmed using a cell-free system of radical generation. Our findings suggest that quercetin protects mouse thymocytes from oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis and modulates the intracellular redox state through its antioxidant activity.</span></div></label></td>\

When these normal human cells were incubated with each flavonoid in culture medium for 24 h, some of the flavonoids showed considerable cytotoxicity at relatively high concentrations and in a dose-dependent manner. 3-Hydroxyflavone, luteolin, and apigenin were more toxic toward TIG-1 cells than the other flavonoids, and luteolin, 3-hydroxyflavone, and quercetin were more toxic toward HUVE cells. HUVE cells were more vulnerable to flavonoid cytotoxicity than TIG-1 cells. Using 2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCF-DA), the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level of flavonoid-treated TIG-1 cells was examined. The ROS level increased significantly in the presence of the flavone apigenin or luteolin or the flavonol 3-hydroxyflavone, quercetin, or kaempherol. These results suggest that these flavones and flavonols exert cytotoxicity through increasing intracellular ROS levels. Further, the incorporation of apigenin, 3-hydroxyflavone, luteolin, and quercetin, which are more toxic, into TIG-1 cells during 24-h incubation was examined. These flavonoids were incorporated into them and the order of their incorporation efficiency was similar to that of their cytotoxicity. In conclusion, some flavonoids are cytotoxic at higher concentrations toward human normal cells. Further, it is suggested that they are incorporated into cells, increase intracellular ROS levels, and then exert cytotoxicity.</span></div></label></td>\
